### Ohtani's Unprecedented 2021 Season
Ohtani had a truly remarkable 2021 season for the Los Angeles Angels, during which he demonstrated his unique ability to excel both as a pitcher and hitter at the major league level. On the mound, Ohtani started 23 games and posted a 3.18 ERA over 130 innings pitched while also maintaining excellent control. At the plate, Ohtani led all of MLB with 46 home runs to go along with a .257 batting average and .373 on-base percentage. This unprecedented two-way production earned Ohtani a unanimous MVP award in recognition of his historic contributions to the Angels in multiple facets of the game.

### Evaluating Ohtani's Pitching Performance  
As one of the American League's top starting pitchers in 2021, Ohtani held opposing batters to a low batting average and minimized home runs allowed. Through consistent command of his fastball, splitter, and slider, Ohtani was able to pile up strikeouts start after start while also limiting baserunners. This combination of elite stuff and control positioned Ohtani among the league leaders in ERA and WHIP for much of the season.

### Analyzing Ohtani's Batting Numbers
Hitting in the two-hole for the Angels' lineup, Ohtani made his presence known on a nightly basis both as a power and contact hitter. In addition to leading all of MLB with his 46 home runs, Ohtani consistently drove in runs and crossed home plate himself thanks to a high on-base percentage. He also terrified defenses with 26 stolen bases, showcasing his five-tool skillset that is seldom seen from a player with his level of pitching acumen.

### Market for Ohtani's Services in Free Agency
As one of the rarest talents the game has ever seen, Ohtani is expected to command one of the largest contracts in baseball history when he reaches free agency after the 2023 season. Major market clubs like the Yankees, Red Sox, and Dodgers are seen as the frontrunners to pursue Ohtani and outbid their competitors given their financial muscle. However, the Angels will do everything in their power to retain their franchise cornerstone, who they drafted in 2018 and whose unique abilities captivate audiences around the world. 

### Setting Precedents with Next Contract
Regardless of uniform, Ohtani's next contract promises to shatter records for annual salary among pitchers and position players alike. As the first true two-way star of the modern MLB era, Ohtani is certain to reset expectations for compensation reflective of his immense two-sided value. It remains to be seen if his next deal eclipses $300 million, but it would raise the bar for two-way players who follow and for teams looking to acquire complete game-changing talents like Ohtani.

### Cements Legacy as One of MLB's Most Dominant Forces  
Though still just 28 years old, Ohtani has already accomplished more than most careers through four MLB seasons. If he can sustain this historic level of excellence on both sides of the ball deep into his 30s, Ohtani's case for the Hall of Fame will be a lock. For years to come, he is poised to be one of the faces of Major League Baseball globally thanks to his singular skills and production that transcend traditional offensive or pitching categories.

### Opportunity and Challenge for Angels
In order to retain their homegrown superstar beyond 2023, the Angels must make Ohtani's renewal their number one priority. Failing to re-sign him would represent a massive blow to the franchise and its chances of contending for championships in the near future. The outcome of Ohtani's looming free agency decision will define the organization's trajectory for years to come in both competitive and financial terms.

### Ohtani's Free Agency Decision Looms Large  
Speculation around Ohtani's plans starting in late 2023 is certain to dominate baseball headlines throughout both the season and subsequent offseason. No matter his choice of destination, a formal announcing of his next long-term commitment is poised to garner significant publicity for the chosen organization. With his unique gifts continuing to fascinate audiences worldwide, Ohtani's future moves will undoubtedly leave a lasting mark on the modern game.
