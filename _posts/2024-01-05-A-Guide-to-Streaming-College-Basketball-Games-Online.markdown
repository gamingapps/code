### Checking Team and Conference Websites
College basketball fans should always check the official team and conference websites first for streaming options. Many provide live video streams of home games right on their sites. Conference networks in particular ensure all league matchups are available to watch online. Be sure to browse each team's schedule page for streaming links as availability can vary by opponent. Conference portal sites aggregate streams from member schools in one place as well. Social media is another location to monitor, as teams may promote streams on platforms like Twitter and Facebook.

### Popular Subscription Services for Basketball
ESPN+ has grown to be a popular subscription choice for basketball fans, streaming hundreds of out-of-market games each season. For $6.99 a month or $69.99 annually, subscribers get access to an extensive library of live events. CBS Sports has also invested in their own CBS All Access streaming platform, carrying the CBS-televised NCAA tournament games and select regular season matchups. Conference-focused services such as the Big Ten Network+, ACC Network Extra, and Pac-12 Network live stream games too through dedicated digital subscriptions. 

### Watch Games Through Live TV Streaming
Live TV streaming services provide access to sports programming and games in the same way as traditional cable or satellite. Services like Hulu Live TV, YouTube TV, Sling Blue and Sling Orange, FuboTV, and AT&T TV Now carry many of the sports channels broadcasting basketball like ESPN, CBS Sports Network, FOX Sports, and NBC Sports. Subscribers gain access to live streams of games on those channels through the apps, as well as DVR functionality for recording games. Be sure to confirm a service includes all needed regional sports networks too for full basketball access.

### Utilizing Television Broadcasts Online
While many fans want to stream games, don't overlook television broadcasts that are also available online. National networks airing games like ESPN and CBS post NBA and top college matchups live on their sites and apps free with participating TV provider credentials. Regional sports networks simulcast telecasts digitally as well. Make sure to check channel listings, through providers or network websites, to know broadcast times and tune in. Most have user-friendly streaming players integrated.

### Checking With Your TV Provider
 subscribers should ask their cable, satellite, or live TV streaming provider directly about college basketball coverage as part of their services. Sports packages with regional sports networks and additional ESPN/CBN channels may be included at no added cost. Smaller local providers occasionally air community college games too. Customer service representatives can specify what basketball programming a subscription offers for accessing games. It never hurts to ask what their options are for viewing games online too through supported devices.

### Potential Free Streams on Social Media
Though less common, basketball schools may share occasional free streams of home games on their official social media pages like Twitter, Facebook, YouTube, or elsewhere. This tends to be reserved for less visible non-conference matchups. Conference accounts similarly stream select national games without regional restrictions. Be sure to regularly follow team and league social handles nearby game days for potential live stream links in mentions, videos, or shares. Streams are often unplanned so last-minute checking could uncover a free watch option.

### Pay-Per-View College Basketball Events
While pay-per-view sports events aren't abundant, a handful of streaming providers do offer occasional one-time purchases for premier college matchups. PPV basketball games are usually reserved for marquee non-conference showdowns between top programs early in the season. The price for these streams typically ranges from $5-$15 depending on the game significance. Streams are only accessible through supported devices and apps of participating services during the broadcast window. PPV games don't happen often but can be a great paid live viewing option for standout games that aren't televised locally.

### Using a VPN to Access Geography-Restricted Streams 
For fans located abroad or wanting to watch regionally blocked broadcast streams stateside, a VPN could uncover new options. VPN services mask device location and IP address, makingStreams may work that are actually restricted due to geography. While this method sits in a legal gray area, quality can be unreliable depending on VPN server distance and speed. It's also worth noting VPNs aren't supported by all video players and may violate platform terms of use. Overall though, they present another way to potentially find streams when other official methods come up short.

### Attending Games Live On Campus 
The best way to really experience college basketball atmosphere is attending games in-person at the arena. Student sections traditionally offer some of the most affordable tickets available when space allows. On-campus arenas usually provide live game broadcasts through closed networks only accessible within facilities as well. Catching a few home games spreads school spirit and supports the team directly in their championship pursuit. Memories made watching close action unfold live last a lifetime over any streaming alternative.
