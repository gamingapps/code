## Finding Restaurants that Offer Free Refills
Some popular Japanese restaurant chains that are great for free refills include Yoshinoya and Sukiya, known for their gyudon beef bowls. Both of these restaurants allow unlimited free rice and green tea refills. Another frugal option is Matsuya, which offers free shaved ice dessert refills. 

When asking a staff member for a refill in Japanese, simply say "Okawari dekimasuka?". This politely asks "May I have a refill?". Food blogs and forums also note student-focused restaurants tend to provide generous refill policies. Be sure to check online reviews and speak with locals to find budget-friendly Japanese spots near you.

## Appreciating the Hard Work that Goes into Every Grain of Rice   
In Japan, there is a saying about the "seven gods" that help cultivate each grain of rice - the gods of water, soil, wind, sunshine, insects, clouds and farmers. Rice represents the blessings received from each of these elements that come together to produce this humble yet nourishing crop. Taking a moment to silently thank these entities can help foster gratitude for the food on one's plate.

### Investing in Quality Ingredients and Cooking Tools
 When making rice at home, it's best to use a high-grade variety like Koshihikari that has a soft, moist texture and sweet flavor. Polishing rice with a home milling machine removes any impurities for perfect grains. An expensive Japanese-brand rice cooker, especially ones known for maintaining consistent heat, produces rice with a distinctive taste. Cooking rice in soft, mineral-rich water allows it to absorb flavor fully. Thoroughly rinsing the grains before cooking removes excess starch so each one remains distinct.

## Ordering Classic Japanese Dishes and Specialties     
Japan has so many affordable, delicious staple dishes perfect for everyday meals or special occasions. Popular options found nationwide include ramen, sushi, yakitori (grilled chicken), okonomiyaki (savoury pancakes), and tonkatsu (breaded pork cutlets). For variety, try visiting areas known best for certain regional specialties like seafood in Kyushu or Kobe beef in Kansai. Whether dining out alone or with others, Japan's cuisine caters to all cravings and budgets.

### Dining Etiquette and Customs in Japanese Restaurants
Many restaurants display incredibly realistic "sample" food displays at their entrances to attract customers. These are meant to show the presentation, not be eaten. Staff won't rush customers to finish or leave tables open for others either. It's generally unacceptable to bring food from outside, though some family restaurants allow small bento boxes. Being respectful of traditions helps foreigners better appreciate Japanese hospitality.

## Estimating Restaurant Budgets and Typical Meal Prices
Budget around 2,000 to 4,000 yen for a filling meal at a modest restaurant. Mid-range casual establishments can cost 4,000 to 8,000 yen per person. High-end sushiya or kaiseki multicourse meals may run 10,000 yen or more. Typical prices include 700-1,000 yen for ramen, 500-1,000 yen for yakitori skewers, 1,000-2,000 yen for tender beef bowls or donburi, and 800-1,500 yen for five pieces of sushi. Factor in 200-500 yen for drinks too. With this in mind, it's easy to dine affordably across Japan. 

## Japanese Restaurant Cuisine Basics
While you may encounter samples not meant for eating, authenticity and freshness are still keys to true Japanese cooking. Calrose rice, prized for its soft texture after cooking, dominates what you see on most rice restaurant menus nationwide. Even affordable chains take great care in procuring quality ingredients and following traditions passed through generations. Visiting these establishments offers a perfect introduction to Japan's cherished culinary strengths.
