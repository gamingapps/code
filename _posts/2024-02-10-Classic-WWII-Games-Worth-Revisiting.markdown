### Commandos 2: Men of Courage
Commandos 2 is a beloved tactical strategy game from 2001 praised for its realistic missions and difficulty. Players take control of a small team of British commandos conducting daring raids and sabotage missions behind enemy lines in Nazi-occupied Europe. With only a handful of soldiers under your command, careful planning and coordination is required to complete each objective. Soldiers have different specialized skills like demolition, climbing, and stealth that must be used together. Missions involve sneaking past patrols, disarming explosives, and eliminating high-value targets. One wrong move can jeopardize the entire operation. While the interface is a bit dated now, Commandos 2 expertly places the pressure of leading a small unit through perilous situations with realistic consequences. Its immersive missions still provide a challenging experience.

### Red Orchestra 2: Heroes of Stalingrad   
Red Orchestra 2 throws players into some of the bloodiest battles of World War 2 on the Eastern Front. As the name implies, the multiplayer first-person shooter is centered around the pivotal Battle of Stalingrad in 1943. Players can choose from a variety of infantry roles as well as tank commanders and support classes on both the German and Soviet sides. What makes Red Orchestra 2 stand out is its emphasis on realism. Weapon ballistics, gun recoil, and bullet drop are designed to mirror their real-world counterparts. Damage is lethal, with just a few hits potentially taking a soldier out of the fight. Combined with the large-scale battles involving 64 players, Red Orchestra 2 authentically recreates the visceral, chaotic nature of combat during the brutal fighting in and around Stalingrad. Its realistic approach continues attracting dedicated fans today.

### Il-2 Sturmovik
The Il-2 Sturmovik series has been faithfully simulating World War 2 air combat since 2001. The flagship World War 2 combat flight simulator, it allows players to take the controls of an extensive lineup of fighter planes from the era, including classics like the P-51 Mustang, Fw 190, and Yak-3. Under the hood, Il-2 Sturmovik prioritizes precise flight modeling, intuitive but complex damage systems, and an obsessive level of historical accuracy that makes each plane feel unique to fly. From the cockpit view, every gauge, switch and instrument has been recreated in stunning detail. Missions drop the player into thousands of historically inspired scenarios across the various theaters of war. While not for those seeking a more arcade-style experience, Il-2 Sturmovik remains the gold standard for authentically capturing the thrills and rigors of piloting warplanes during World War 2.

### Close Combat Series
The Close Combat real-time tactical series has challenged players since 1996 with its gritty, small-unit infantry combat. Set across various WW2 campaigns in Europe and the Pacific, Close Combat focuses on leading squads and platoons through key battles and missions. Players are responsible for all the minute details of a ground unit like ammo counts, supplies, troop morale, and issuing coordinated orders utilizing things like covering fire and smoke grenades. One wrong move can end in disaster against a competent AI. Close Combat games are praised for their immense attention to historical detail and immersive mechanics that make every bullet and life meaningful. Failure is always a possibility requiring adaptive tactics to prevail against tough odds. The challenging missions do an outstanding job of placing players in the boots of a squad leader facing the stress and difficulties of small team combat in World War 2. 

### Hearts of Iron Series
For those seeking to command entire countries and orchestrate global strategy, the Hearts of Iron series provides an in-depth grand strategy experience. Players take control of nearly every nation at the start of World War 2 and guide their country's rise and challenges throughout the conflict. Management involves overseeing every aspect of a nation from resources, technology research, politics, diplomacy and production before building out massive armies, navies and air forces. Once prepared, real turn-based or real-time campaigns see empires clash on interactive maps spanning multiple theaters of war. Hearts of Iron games do remarkable work modeling the complexity of running a country at war. Their engaging gameplay systems and historical plausibility continue fascinating strategy fans interested in alternate histories and What If scenarios from World War 2.

### Company of Heroes
The acclaimed Company of Heroes transported real-time strategy fans directly into iconic battles throughout Normandy, Italy and beyond. Released in 2006, it achieved critical acclaim for its detailed recreations of Company-level combat set within destructible environments. Players must carefully manage limited Company assets like infantry, vehicles, and support powers while directing fireteams across interactive battlefields. What sets Company of Heroes apart is its intense focus on infantry and combined arms assaults. Units feel vulnerable and their suppression and morale function realistically. All the while, destruction dynamically changes the map, creating new opportunities or threats. Company of Heroes immerses the player directly into the small unit actions that decided the course of major WW2 battles. Over a decade later, its excellent missions and authentic realism still captivate fans reliving or experiencing these pivotal moments of history.

### Call of Duty & Brothers in Arms Series 
Two famous FPS franchises that helped popularize the WW2 setting were Call of Duty and Brothers in Arms. While taking different approaches, both told impactful narratives showcasing the personal stories and actions across various WWII campaigns. Call of Duty placed players within iconic missions retelling key battles like Stalingrad, Normandy and beyond through scripted cinematic experiences. Brothers in Arms offered a more squad-focused perspective as players took command of a rifle squad participating in operations throughout Europe from D-Day to the Rhineland. Both franchises helped memorialize the heroism and sacrifices of the "Greatest Generation" while delivering thrilling and emotional single-player experiences. Their authentic recreations of weapons, environments and historical events educated many about World War II's human cost and milestones in an accessible way. Call of Duty and Brothers in Arms remain influential with consistently well-made campaigns that continue finding new fans.

### Hidden Gems  
A few other excellent WW2 games that may be lesser known but still hold up include Gary Grigsby's War in the West, Day of Defeat and Secret Weapons of the Luftwaffe. War in the West delivers a strategic board game-like depiction of the entire Western Front in Europe, allowing players to direct Allied or Axis resources across multiple turns. Day of Defeat dropped players into the realistic battlefields of a modded Half Life engine to fight as Americans or Germans in varied online multiplayer modes. Secret Weapons of the Luftwaffe puts the player in charge of Germany's experimental aviation programs in a technically challenging management simulation. While small in scope compared to the mega hits, these hidden gems deliver compelling gameplay focused on authentic WW2 experiences worthwhile for dedicated history buffs.

### Timeless Appeal
Two decades since many were first released, these classics continue finding new generations of fans eager to authentically experience pivotal moments of World War 2. While graphics have evolved, their engaging gameplay rooted in realism, historical accuracy and ability to place the player directly into iconic settings and battles result in experiences that remain compelling. The challenge of commanding small units or entire countries, piloting authentic planes or fighting as infantry in epic battles retains fascinating replay value for strategy and action fans alike. In an era saturated with war games, these WW2 classics maintain relevance by honoring history and keeping players continually returning to relive or discover its impactful events in new ways. Their timeless designs ensure this Golden Age of WW2 games remains appreciated for bringing its real human stories and conflicts to interactive life.
