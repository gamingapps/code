## Introduction 

The COVID.gov website allows US households to order 4 free at-home COVID tests that are shipped directly to homes at no cost. Previous orders from the program arrived within 10 days of being placed. At-home tests provide a convenient and accurate way for Americans to monitor their health and slow the spread of the virus.

## Placing an Order

To receive free tests, visit COVIDTests.gov and enter your residential delivery address. The website will ask for your name, street address, apartment number if applicable, city, state, and zip code to validate your address and allow USPS to deliver the kits. You'll also provide an email address so the program can send order tracking updates. Households are currently limited to one order (4 tests) per residential address to ensure broad access across the country. 

### Receiving Test Results

At-home rapid antigen tests produce results within 30 minutes without needing to visit a lab for processing. All results, whether positive or negative, should be reported to local health authorities through partner websites like MakeMyTestCount.org to aid in community surveillance and pandemic response efforts. Anyone who tests positive should follow current CDC isolation guidance and consider talking to a doctor about COVID treatment options if at higher risk for severe illness.

### Stocking Up for Travel Season 

As the holidays approach and many COVID restrictions lift, travel within the US is expected to significantly increase. Staying updated on free at-home tests helps reduce infection risks for travelers and their destinations. Not taking advantage of the free program shows a lack of concern for public health, especially during busy travel seasons with indoor gatherings where virus spread can easily occur. Advanced planning helps ensure testing availability for concerned citizens.

## Global Access to Free Tests

While extremely valuable for supplementing testing access within the US, this national free at-home testing program is only available to US households due to domestic funding and distribution infrastructure. Many other developed countries also subsidize the cost of rapid tests or make them freely available through national health services, though limited global supplies and challenges with logistics in some areas still exist.

## Verifying Test Accuracy

At-home rapid antigen tests provide a convenient testing option for most Americans, and studies show they are very accurate at detecting COVID-19 when a person's viral load is high during their most infectious period. However, a negative result does not rule out infection and all exposed individuals should continue taking extra precautions like masking around others if symptomatic. Confirmatory PCR tests may still be advised in some cases at a doctor or testing site's direction. 

## Closing Thoughts

Free universal access to rapid at-home COVID-19 testing plays a critical ongoing role in the US pandemic response strategy as the virus enters this next phase. Combining strategies like boosters, masking, improved ventilation and periodic testing is key to limiting infections and keeping schools and the economy open safely. This federal program helps to remove testing barriers that could disproportionately impact lower-income and vulnerable Americans with less access to care.
