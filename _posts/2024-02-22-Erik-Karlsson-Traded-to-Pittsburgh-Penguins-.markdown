## Skill and Fit
### Elite skating and puck skills
Erik Karlsson would be an offensive force with the Penguins. His elite skating and puck handling would mesh perfectly with their uptempo style. Karlsson sees the ice at an incredible level and can quarterback the powerplay. His elite transition game and passing would take the Penguins to another level.

### Questions about defense
However, there are questions about how well Karlsson's game would translate defensively to the Penguins system. He is not known for his physicality or strong positional play in his own zone. Adapting to the Penguins structure under Mike Sullivan could be an adjustment for Karlsson.

## Salary Cap Issues  
### Karlsson's large contract
Signing Karlsson to an $11.5 million cap hit until 2027 would be a huge financial commitment. The Penguins are already tight against the cap with stars like Crosby, Malkin and Letang signed long term. Finding the cap space for Karlsson would not be easy.

### Sharks unwilling to retain enough money
While teams can retain up to 50% of a players salary, the Sharks are only willing to keep $2-3 million of Karlsson's deal. The Penguins want more like $4 million retained to make the finances work. Both sides will need to compromise on the salary retention amount.

## Potential Three Team Trade
### Involving a third team 
A deals seems unlikely with the current cap situations. A third team may need to get involved to take on some salary in a larger multi-player trade. The Red Wings and Sabres have been mentioned as options with cap space to help facilitate a Karlsson trade.

## Other Options If No Karlsson Deal  
### Dumping Granlund's contract
If trading for Karlsson falls through, the Penguins could look to move Mikael Granlund's $5 million cap hit entirely. Finding a trade partner for his entire salary may prove difficult.

### Pursuing Jeff Petry
Montreal defenseman Jeff Petry is reportedly on the Penguins radar. But his partial no-trade clause complicates a potential deal, especially to the Sharks. More creative moves would be required.

## Managing Goalie Workload
### Splitting starts evenly
One way to keep both Tristan Jarry and Casey DeSmith fresh all season would be to aim for a roughly even 50-50 split of starts. However, performance, injuries and the team's needs will dictate ice time more than any preset plan. 

## Developing Defense Prospects  
### Korchinski's junior season  
Top prospect Kevin Korchinski returning to juniors for another dominating season makes sense. It would allow him to further hone his puck skills against lesser opponents. But he also appears ready for the NHL if he impresses in training camp.

## Conclusion  
#### Closing Thoughts
While Karlsson seems a talent fit, the financial hurdles may stop this deal. Creative roster moves will be needed either to make cap room or bring in a third team. The team remains focused on bolstering defense through trades or prospects. But finding the right fit within a tight cap will not be easy.
