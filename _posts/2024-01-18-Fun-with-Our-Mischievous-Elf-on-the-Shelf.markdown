## Introduction 

Our elf Nickelfront has certainly kept us entertained this Christmas season! Within just a few days of arriving at our home, he began playing all sorts of tricks and getting into mischief around the house. Now our kids look forward to seeing what antics Nickelfront will get up to each day. They enthusiastically tell us about his latest adventures each night.   

Nickelfront's first week with us was full of shenanigans. He seemed determined to cause as much trouble as possible!

### Early Shenanigans

Nickelfront wasted no time starting his mischief. One of his earliest pranks involved sneaking into our neighbor's house to follow their elf. We later spotted him trying to replace their elf's clothes with costumes from our kids' dress up box! Nickelfront also thought it would be hilarious to sneak some vodka into our Christmas tree, hoping we wouldn't notice the odd smell. Thankfully we caught him in time! Our elf also enjoys tormenting our pets. On more than one occasion, we found poor Mittens stuck inside laundry baskets or chasing toy mice that Nickelfront enchanted to move on their own. His antics truly know no bounds.

### Master of Hide and Seek

Nickelfront is incredibly sly when it comes to hiding from our kids each morning. Sometimes it takes them hours to finally track him down, tucked away in the most bizarre spots imaginable. Just last week, they searched the entire house for over two days only to discover him peeking out from inside our air vent grille! Another time, they found Nickelfront squeezing into space between our wall and dresser, an impressive feat for such a tiny elf. He's even deleted photos of his misdeeds from our phones to cover his tracks after getting caught. Our kids are challenged to always think outside the box when playing hide and seek with Nickelfront.

### Wild Youtube Binges 

One night, it seemed Nickelfront's mischief had finally caught up with him. We discovered the little elf passed out on the couch in a messy state. Crumpled chips and cookie crumbs covered the cushions around him. It was clear Nickelfront had stayed up through the wee hours of the morning indulging in questionable online videos. When we tried to wake him, all we heard was incoherent mumbling about "cinammon toast crunch" and "youtube haikus". It seemed his late night internet binge had drained all his energy! We gently tucked him into bed, hoping he'd learned his lesson about overdoing the snacks and screens.

### Devious Tricks and Pranks

As the holiday season wears on, Nickelfront has grown more ingenious with his schemes. Just last weekend, he left a series of riddles and clues hidden around the house, secreting small treats in each location for the kids to find. You should have seen their excited faces as they followed the trail, calling out each discovery. "I found the Hershey's kiss in the drawer!" another shouted. "There's jelly beans under the couch cushion!" Nickelfront watched with pure glee as their search carried into every room. Another time, he orchestrated an elaborate prank involving flour and the bathroom that left our whole family in stitches. His tricks keep us all on our toes!

### The Great Escape Plan  

When we jokingly threatened to send a letter of complaint to Santa about Nickelfront's relentless mischief, the elf panicked. That very night, we discovered all of our car keys mysteriously missing from their usual spots. In a panic, we searched high and low to no avail. It wasn't until morning that we noticed the back door standing wide open. It seems our wily elf had hatched an escape plan, afraid of facing the consequences from the North Pole. Thankfully, after much coaxing with chocolate chips, we managed to convince Nickelfront to call off his great escape. But you better believe he'll think twice before pushing his luck again!

### Lessons Learned

While Nickelfront certainly pushes the limits of his duties, we've grown fond of the joy and laughter he brings our home each Christmas. Our kids will never forget this memorable holiday season filled with the elf's hilarious antics and tricks. As for Nickelfront, we hope the North Pole can help whip him back into proper elf shape for next year's assignment! With any luck, he'll tone down the mischief just a smidge. But honestly, we wouldn't have it any other way. Wishing everyone a joyous end to this Christmas season from our delightfully mischievous little elf!
