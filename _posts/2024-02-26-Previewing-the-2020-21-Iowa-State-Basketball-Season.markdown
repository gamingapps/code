## Experience and Talent Returning  

### Returning Starters and Depth
Iowa State returns four of five starters from last season's team that won 24 games. Much of their rotation players also return, giving this core valuable experience together. Having a experienced group will help as they look to reach bowl games in consecutive seasons. With four starters and key reserves back, the Cyclones will lean on that experience and familiarity.

### Potent Offense Led By Guards  
The Cyclones have a potent offense that will be led by talented guards Rasir Bolton and Tyrese Haliburton. Bolton averaged 15.9 points per game while displaying his scoring knack. Haliburton contributed 12.6 points and also showed his playmaking skills with 6.5 assists per contest. Forward Solomon Young also is back after giving them 9.5 points and 5.5 rebounds nightly. This experienced trio will look to power the offense again.

## Questions on Defense

### Interior Defense a Question Mark
Iowa State allowed 72 points per game last year, below their standard. Losing defensive anchor Michael Jacobson in the post could impact their ability to protect the rim. Younger bigs will need to step up inside to fill that void on the stat sheet and in the paint. 

### Young Players Must Step Up
The Cyclones return experience but some reserves who saw action last year will need to take another step on the defensive end. Their depth and familiarity should aid in their understanding of concepts. However, improving defensively from a statistical standpoint is something coach Prohm will emphasize.

## Tough Schedule in Top Conference  

### Challenging Big 12 Slate
The Big 12 remains one of the best conferences from top to bottom. Iowa State will battle nightly against top competition both home and away. Merely finishing in the top half of the league would be seen as a win. 

### Goals of Big 12 Success
This experienced Iowa State team has NCAA hopes. Finishing top four in the Big 12 would confirm their status amongst the league's elite. Earning a double-bye into the conference tournament quarterfinals is an achievable benchmark. Contending deep into March is the expected goal.

## Player to Watch - Rasir Bolton

### Emerging Primary Scorer 
Bolton proved last season he could be the main scoring option. Averaging nearly 16 points, he got buckets from all levels. With another year, Bolton looks to hone his playmaking.

### Taking Next Step as Facilitator
Bolton shows potential as a combo guard who can dish in addition to score. Improving his ball-handling and court vision would make him an even scarier threat that defenses must account for at all times.  

### All-Conference Potential  
If Bolton continues progressing overall, he could be in for a huge junior campaign. His scoring prowess and expanded game could lift him to All-Big 12 honors. Bolton looms as a key benchmark of Iowa State's success.

## Non-Conference Schedule Provides Tests

### Challenging Road Games Early
In the early non-conference slate, the Cyclones face tough road tests against powerhouses Memphis and Seton Hall. Quality challenges versus Creighton and in-state rival Iowa won't be easy either. 

### Securing Quality Wins Is Key
Going .500 or better in the non-league would set up Iowa State nicely. Notching signature victories on a strong resume, especially away from home, could boost their at-large profile for March. Quality non-conference wins are always important come selection time.

## Goal of Return Trip to NCAA Tournament  

### Regular Tournament Presence
Under coach Prohm, Iowa State has become a mainstay in the NCAA Tournament. Last year's 24 wins marked their highest total since 2016. Making "The Big Dance" is always the expectation for teams with tournament aspirations.

### Talent and Experience Provide Opportunity
With so much returning production and experience, this team is built for another postseason run. If they reach their potential, a fifth straight trip to the NCAA Tournament is well within reach. This group aims to bring Iowa State back to March Madness.

## Potential X-Factor - Tre Jackson

### Developing Into a Reliable Starter  
As a freshman, Jackson showed flashes but must take a step forward. If he can reliably provide secondary scoring and playmaking, it elevates the team's ceiling significantly.  

### Areas for Improvement
Becoming a more consistent perimeter shooter and improving his on-ball defense are items on Jackson's offseason checklist. With a year of experience, those aspects of his game could blossom in year two.

### Impact of Jackson's Progression  
If Jackson develops as hoped into a reliable starter, it gives Iowa State another talented ball-handler and scorer. His all-around progression could signify how far this team ultimately goes.

## Final Prediction - Top 4 Finish, 23+ Wins

With the experience and talent on the roster, this could be one of coach Prohm's most complete teams. Shooting for 23 or more wins and a top four placing in the challenging Big 12 seems achievable. The conference gauntlet will be tough as always, but this Cyclones group has the tools and know-how for success. If they play to their potential, a fifth straight trip to the NCAA Tournament is well within reach.
