## Introduction 

Forex trading presents both opportunities for profit as well as risks. An expert advisor, also known as an EA, is an automated trading system that can place trades on behalf of a trader based on pre-programmed strategies and rules. With many EAs available on the market, finding the right one that fits a trader's objectives and risk tolerance requires careful research and consideration. Some key factors must be evaluated when selecting an automated trading system.

## Do Your Research

Traders should take the time to learn about the different types of automated trading strategies that EAs employ, such as trend-following and counter-trend strategies. Understanding the specific technical indicators and rules a system uses to generate buy and sell signals is important. Researching third party reviews and comments from other traders can provide valuable insight into an EA's performance track record. Checking metrics like win rates, average profits per trade, maximum drawdowns experienced, and longest winning and losing streaks gives a good sense of what to expect from a system. With so many options available, doing thorough due diligence up front helps narrow down choices.  

### Understanding Strategy Types

The two main categories of automated trading strategies are trend-following and counter-trend systems. Trend-following EAs look to enter trades in the direction of the prevailing trend, while counter-trend systems take positions against short-term movements looking to profit from mean reversion. Traders must evaluate which approach better fits their risk tolerance and market view.

### Research Performance Records 

In addition to reviewing any documentation and studies provided by developers, researching third party websites that evaluate and backtest many EAs against historical data provides valuable comparison metrics. Comments from other traders sharing their experience forward trading a system live can confirm or contradict claimed results. Carefully assessing objective performance metrics and anecdotal feedback paints the fullest picture of what to realistically expect.

### Consider Broker Compatibility

Not all brokers enable or properly support the use of automated trading robots on their platforms. Some limit the number of trades an EA can place per day or have restrictions on the use of certain indicators or code. It's important for a trader to select a forex broker that fully enables the strategy and style of the chosen EA. Low spreads, high leverage, large trade sizes, and a platform optimized for automated systems are important compatibility factors to check. Avoid frustration by confirming broker support up front.

## Backtest Thoroughly 

One of the most important steps in evaluating a new EA is thorough backtesting on historical market data. This allows analyzing long term performance without risking real money. Backtesting across multiple currency pairs and timeframes helps determine a system's consistency in various environments. Important questions to answer include: How does the EA handle periods of high volatility, trends, ranging markets and other conditions? Testing on short term charts in addition to daily can provide greater insight. Optimizing settings based on backtesting results allows refining an EA for even better performance before going live.

### Evaluate Across Pairs and Timeframes  

In-depth backtesting examines not just overall metrics but also inspects results on individual currency pairs over different durations, from daily and weekly charts all the way down to the hourly and 30-minute. Some EAs may work very well on EUR/USD but struggle on GBP/JPY for example. Comparing performance at various time intervals also spotlights potential issues like drawdown spikes on shorter timeframes that daily charts may mask. Thorough testing eliminates potential surprises down the road.

### Optimize Settings for Backtested Results

Advanced backtesting platforms allow optimizing an EA's code and adjustable parameters like lot sizing, take profit targets, and stop losses based on tested performance. Systematically tweaking values and recording the impact on key metrics like average profitability, maximum drawdown and others, makes it possible to refine the strategy for improved potential results before going live. This research improves the odds of viable forward testing outcomes.

## Start with a Demo Account  

Once satisfied with backtesting outcomes, forward testing a system with virtual funds using a demo account provides a risk-free method for gaining experience operating it in real-time market conditions before risking capital. Most brokers offer robust demo environments that accurately mirror live trading servers. Demo trading helps identify and troubleshoot any potential code issues, gives practice managing trades, and allows optimizing settings discovered during backtesting to see real-world impact. Forward testing on a demo account builds confidence before placing real money on the line.

### Practice Risk-Free Trade Management

A demo account provides an opportunity to get hands-on practice operating the EA without financial risk. This experience helps traders become proficient at monitoring trades, adjusting settings on the fly if needed without stress, and practicing orderly position closure utilizing protective stops or profit targets discovered to be optimal through backtesting. Forward testing on a virtual platform builds skills managing not just profits but losses too in a low pressure environment. Demo trading is a key intermediate step bridging backtesting results to live trading success.

### Optimize for Forward Results 

Using a demo can help further refine optimal parameters found through backtesting by seeing real-world trade executions and adjusting values to improve performance in forward motion. By continuing to optimize based on observable outcomes rather than past data, it strengthens the effectiveness of moving to a funded account. Recording tracked metrics like average wins versus losses and drawdown periods in demo mode helps establish performance benchmarks to evaluate once trading for real. Overall it builds confidence to transition successfully.

## Monitor Performance Closely 

Once live trading begins, ongoing review remains crucial. Backtesting historical data is one step removed from real-time markets so monitoring an EAâ€˜s ongoing forward metrics helps ensure it continues performing as expected. Regularly reviewing updated backtests on new data over time can identify any declining or inconsistent performance requiring adjustment. Watching trades, wins versus losses, average profits and maximum drawdowns under live conditions confirms proper functionality and risk management. This close oversight ensures addressing issues promptly before significant adverse impacts occur.

### Review Backtesting Over Time 

While backtesting is useful for initial evaluation, markets are dynamic so strategies can start to perform differently as conditions change. Regularly reviewing how an EA performed in new backtests run on recent historical data helps highlight if tweaks may be needed to maintain effectiveness. Comparing to benchmarks from optimization can spot declining relative performance signaling the need for adjustments sooner than waiting for adverse forward results. Ongoing backtesting over time safeguards continued success.

### Monitor Real-Time Trade Activity

Seeing trade entries, position sizes, stops triggered and profits locked in for an EA forward running in live conditions offers the most transparency. Careful review ensures actions match expectations. Any divergences like loss sizes exceeding norms or absence of normal winning periods calls for prompt assessment. Operators should watch closely enough to recognize issues early enabling timely intervention like disabling the robot or fine-tuning settings to protecting capital and strategy integrity. 

## Manage Risk Appropriately

Even with the best coding and strategy selection, achieving long term profits in trading requires prudent money management practices. Automated systems are not immune to corrections, losses or drawdowns. Operators need controls in place to keep betting sizes reasonable and preserve capital.

### Use Proper Position Sizing

Establishing maximum risk guidelines based on a percentage of account equity prevents over-leveraging and ensures adequate flexibility to absorb adverse market moves. Operators should pre-specify maximum position sizes tailored to the volatility handled through extensive backtesting. Larger bets concentrate risk rather than mitigating it.

### Employ Protective Stop-Loss Orders 

All trades, whether from an EA or placed manually, require defined risk parameters. Stops protect open positions from excessive losses by automatically closing trades that move against the predicted direction beyond pre-set adverse levels. Proper location factors in spread costs and slippage to avoid premature exits yet still curb significant downside. Stops safeguard capital, a vital element to long run success.

### Diversify Risk Across Pairs or Strategies

Concentrating all investments in one automated or manual system carries unnecessary risk versus spreading allocation across multiple independent strategies. Operators benefit more by running distinct EAs targeting different currency pairs driven by unrelated factors, or separate rules-based programs. Even a single loss then does maximum 50% equity damage versus potential ruin of relying on solo outcome. Diversification reduces overall risk profile substantially.

## Keep Learning and Improving

While automation handles daily trading execution, the human element continues overseeing. Ongoing research and education keeps pace with shifting market dynamics. Some fine-tune code based on developing analysis, others engage professional consultants experienced at optimizing complex systems. Learning never stops for traders hoping long-term success. Operators who remain committed to honing skills place themselves in the best position to profit from opportunities amidst changing landscapes. Constant advancement strengthens the chances.

### Refine Strategies Over Time

Markets undergo trends and rotations requiring dynamic strategies to also evolve strategies staying at peak relevance. Some systems may demand periodic rule set adjustments keeping up, while others may require complete rewrites. Operators able to recognize when strategies diverge too far from current realities and take action redesigning systems position themselves for sustained profitability over the long haul. Growth improves competitive positioning.  

### Consider Outside Expert Assistance  

More complex multi-factor EAs sometimes benefit from outside expertise helping optimize code performance as markets change. Professional advisors experienced continually developing and testing advanced systems lend capable support. Their guidance aids operators in extracting full upside potential from sophisticated programs especially when analysis skills may lag coding abilities. Outside help enhances the value of well-crafted systems.
