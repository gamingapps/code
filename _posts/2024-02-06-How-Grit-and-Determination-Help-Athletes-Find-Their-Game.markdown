## Connor Clifton's development and positive impact

Connor Clifton has shown tremendous growth in his game over the past season with the Boston Bruins. Undrafted out of Quinnipiac University, Clifton began the season playing in the AHL but was called up due to injuries on the Bruins blue line. At first, Clifton struggled to find his place in the NHL but he refused to give up. Through determination and hard work, Clifton began to discover his unique strengths. While not the most skilled defenseman, Clifton makes up for it with his physicality, tenacity, and hockey IQ. He relentlessly battles along the boards and actively pushes the pace both offensively and defensively. 

Clifton's energy and gritty playstyle has become infectious in the Bruins locker room. His relentless work ethic and refusal to back down from any challenge has inspired his teammates to raise their game. In the playoffs, Clifton stepped up with important goals and assists. His aggressive play in the defensive zone also helped shut down opponents top lines. Through dedication to constantly improving, Clifton has cemented himself as an invaluable depth player for the Bruins moving forward.

### The Eagles' mistake in letting LaGarrette Blount go

The Philadelphia Eagles made a critical error in losing power back LaGarrette Blount in free agency after their Super Bowl win. While still effective, Darren Sproles is nearing the end of his career and is undersized to shoulder a full workload. However, Blount proved in New England that at 30-years old, he is still a dominant red zone threat. With 18 touchdowns in 2017, Blount was indispensible in the Patriots goal line sets. 

Furthermore, the Eagles red zone woes in 2018 can be directly traced to losing Blount's abilities near the end zone. With Blount gone, Philly struggled to punch it in during critical moments. The workload then fell to an injured Sproles, who is better utilized in space than as a battering ram. An aging Jay Ajayi couldn't stay healthy either. If the Eagles had re-signed Blount, their offense inside the 20-yard line would have been far more potent.

##  Clifton's abrasive play wins respect in Boston

Since joining the Bruins, Clifton has become affectionately known by Boston fans as "Cliffy Hockey" due to his abrasive, do-whatever-it-takes style of play. Standing at only 6 feet tall, Clifton is not the most physically intimidating defenseman. However, he plays a punishing brand of hockey, finishing every check with relentless tenacity. Opposing players know that Clifton will sacrifice his body to block shots and does not back down from skirmishes along the boards. 

During periods where Clifton's defensive game was not at its sharpest, the Bruins missed his abrasive contributions. Clifton's fearlessness and intensity rubs off positively on his teammates and helps tilt the ice. Boston is a much tougher out when Clifton is engaged physically and playing within his edgy playstyle. Through hard work and maturity, Clifton found consistency to his abrasive game, cementing himself as a fan favorite in Beantown.

### Teams get mad at good players not on their side

Clifton's no-nonsense, balls-to-the-wall style of play frustrates opponents on a nightly basis. The intensity with which Clifton competes in all three zones creates conflicts. Whether finishing heavy checks along the boards or shadowing top lines, Clifton plays the game on the edge. While opponents respect his tenacity, playing against Clifton is an irritant. Good players always draw the ire of opponents, but to have an agitator like Clifton on the other team makes winning that much harder. Clifton plays with zero fear of retribution and seems to relish when he gets under the skin of stars. 

As Clifton continues developing offensively, his ability to frustrate opponents will only increase. Smart positional play and physicality allows Clifton to effectively handle skilled players. This further bugs the opposition to no end. Clifton brings an edge to every shift that every team wants but hardly anyone wants to face. While Clifton dances the line, his gritty play within the rules makes him a nuisance for opponents game in and game out.

## Clifton's maturity and awareness on the ice

Despite only have one year of NHL experience under his belt, Clifton plays the game with a veteran's poise and intelligence. When watching Clifton closely, one can see his high-end objective and situational awareness. Clifton reads developing plays instinctively and is rarely caught out of position. He understands system deployment based on game flow and matchups. Through experience in all levels of hockey, Clifton makes the absolute most out of his modest physical talents.

Clifton's calm demeanor stands out, especially for a young defenseman playing meaningful minutes. He processes the game at an advanced level, scanning the full ice rather than tunnel visioning through zones. Clifton leads rushes prudently and makes tape-to-tape breakout passes. In his own end, Clifton angle takes away shooting lanes and seams without overcommitting. With each repetition, Clifton's natural defensive IQ and reading of body language improves. His mature game belies Clifton's years of service and bodes extremely well for Boston moving ahead.

### Ajayi's injury further exposed Eagles' running back issues 

After the Eagles let Blount walk, Jay Ajayi was brought in to be the lead back. However, Ajayi struggled to stay healthy, playing through knee and back issues. Finally, in Week 5, Ajayi's season came to an abrupt end due to a torn ACL. With Ajayi on IR, Philadelphia turned to undrafted rookie Josh Adams and veteran Darren Sproles as their primary options. While capable, neither player possess Blount's unique attributes as a short-yardage hammer. 

Time and again in 2018, the Eagles stalled inside the 10-yard line. Whether field goals or turnovers, Philadelphia could not consistently finish drives. Offensive coordinator Mike Groh did not adjust quickly enough either, instead opting for finesse plays rather than power runs. Losing Blount was merely papered over rather finding a direct replacement. Until the Eagles add an entrechable goal line back, red zone woes will continue to plague the offense.

### Sproles provides veteran leadership but lacks Blount's skills

At 35 years old, Darren Sproles remains a valuable role player and positive locker room presence. His intelligence and route running are assets on third downs. However, age and extensive career usage have clearly eroded Sproles' abilities as an every down back. At only 5'6" and 190 pounds, Sproles simply does not have the size to consistently move the pile near the goal line. 

While respected, Sproles leadership alone cannot make up for his physical deficiencies compared to Blount. Blount was a classic power back that defenses truly had to game plan for inside the 5-yard line. No longer possessing breakaway speed, Sproles is too easily swallowed up at the point of attack in short yardage. His value now is as a role player and mentor, not a feature back relied upon in high leverage situations. Keeping Blount would have allowed Sproles to remain in a complimentary position suited to his current skills.

## Clifton's desire to find his game and help Bruins again

After a strong playoffs where he began to find his rhythm, Connor Clifton is determined to build upon his late season success heading into the 2019-20 campaign. Clifton spent the summer intensely training to push his conditioning and skills to an elite level. He understands that in order to cement a full time NHL role, Clifton must continue developing in all areas of the defensive game. Through film study and instruction, Clifton is laser focused on improving his reads, angles, and decision making at top speed.

Clifton wants nothing more than to make significant contributions once again for the Bruins, this time from the season's start. With increased responsibility, Clifton aims to bottle up scoring lines through defensive will alone. Offensively, he wants to become more of a factor, whether jumping into rushes or firing shots on goal. Clifton's "never quit" mentality will serve him and Boston well if he actualizes the tools and potential in his toolbox. The Bruins hope they have unearthed a late bloomer ready to emerge as an everyday player.

## Brady's smile handing off to Blount near the goal line

Looking back at tape from the Patriots Super Bowl win, there is no play more telling than Tom Brady's jubilant reaction handing the ball off to LeGarrette Blount near the goal line. Time and again that season, offenses would drive the ball dozens of yards only to wither inside the 10. However, the Patriots had a secret weapon in Blount that struck fear into every defense. At 6'1" and 250 pounds, Blount was a locomotive that grew stronger as he gathered head of steam near the end zone.

Brady understood that turning to Blount with the game on the line was the surest path to six points. Defenses braced for Blount's punishing style, crashing the box with extra bodies
