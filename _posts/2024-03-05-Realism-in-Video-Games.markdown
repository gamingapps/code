## Introduction
Video games depict scenarios and mechanics that are often unrealistic for the sake of balanced and enjoyable gameplay. Common areas where realism is sacrificed include weapon functionality and how characters respond to injury. This blog post analyzes examples of unrealistic weapons and character reactions from popular video games, and discusses the genre impact on realism efforts in gaming. 

### RPG Sights in Call of Duty
Rocket propelled grenade launchers (RPGs) in the Call of Duty franchise are aimed down sights like a scoped rifle, despite RPGs in reality not having an optical sight. A popular meme compares the unrealistic RPG aiming view in games to how one would truly use the weapon without any sighting assistance.

### Throwing Knives in Call of Duty  
Throwing knives provide one-hit kills anywhere on the player model in Call of Duty. However, many real-life body locations hit by a thrown knife would likely be non-lethal wounds, not instant death. Gameplay balance requires simplifying lethality for melee weapons.

### Magazine Sizes in Battlefield Bad Company
The 9A-91 assault rifle in Battlefield Bad Company holds an exaggerated 60 rounds in each magazine, nearly triple the actual 20-round capacity of the real 9A-91. Larger ammo capacities increase time between reloads for improved in-game action.

## Character Reactions

### Damage Absorption in many Shooters
Characters can withstand multiple gunshot hits in many shooters through depleting health bars, rather than going unconscious quickly from blood loss like in reality. This preserves playable characters beyond what human frailty could endure. 

### Shotgun Ranges in Games  
In-game shotguns maintain lethality at much farther distances than the real-world effective range of shot dispersal over just a few meters. Extended one-hit kill ranges balancing shotguns as viable weapons.

### Caliber Lethality Simplification
Most game calibers provide instant deaths from any hit location. In reality, locations like limb shots may wound but not instantly kill. Simplified damage models prioritize fun over authentic wound profiles.  

## Genre Impact on Realism

Arcade shooters focus more on balanced systems that promote enjoyable, repeatable gameplay over strict realism. More realistic damage, injury effects, and mechanics aim to immerse the hardcore mil-sim audience. Even realistic titles take liberties to maintain mass market appeal. 

## Classic Game Examples

### Command & Conquer Futuristic Technology  
The futuristic arsenal in Command & Conquer games from the 1990s, such as Nod weapons, could not exist with the technological capabilities of that era. Creative liberties depicted sci-fi possibilities beyond the times.

### Doom Weapons Defy Physics
Weapons like the plasma gun fire endlessly without realistic overheating or recoil effects. Technical limitations spurred abstract designs prioritizing fun over adherence to laws of physics.

### GoldenEye 007 Health and Damage  
Characters could survive falls, explosions and absorb many bullets like superhuman agents. Simplified systems highlighted responsive shooting without dulling combat with injury micromanagement. 

## Modern Realism Efforts

ArmA and Escape from Tarkov aim for authentic military simulations through ambitious ballistics, injury models and stamina systems. However, total realism hinders mass market appeal. House of the Dead focuses on proper gun handling techniques for immersion. 

## Finding a Balance

Players demand realism only to a point if it undermines enjoyment. Modders offer custom realism preferences unavailable in vanilla releases balanced for broader appeal. Franchises calibrate their realism levels to maximize believability within reason of their intended gameplay experiences. 

## Longevity of Classics

Games like Half-Life and STALKER aged well through atmospheric storytelling and immersive designs that engaged players beyond dated visuals. Emotional connection to crafted worlds can supersede graphical realism when suspension of disbelief succeeds. 

## Conclusion

Total authenticity is unrealistic as a development goal and not necessarily preferable for most games. Franchises refine their balance of realism presentation and mechanics to maximize believability and fun simultaneously over the long-term. As technology progresses, the suspension of disbelief may be tested, requiring continual innovation in pushing graphical and systemic realism within gameplay considerations.
