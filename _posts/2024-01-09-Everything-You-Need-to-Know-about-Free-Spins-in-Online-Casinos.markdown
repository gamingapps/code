## Triggering Free Spins

### Scatter Symbols
Free spins are often triggered by landing a specific number of scatter symbols on the reels which do not need to be on an active payline. Scatter symbols are common icons that trigger bonuses when they land on the reels. Three or more scatter symbols may award 10 free spins, while five scatters could mean 20 spins. Developers design scatters to appear frequently and promote bonus triggering.

### Bonus Rounds
In addition to scatters, some slots offer bonus rounds that are activated by certain symbol combinations. These bonus games provide opportunities to win more free spins as part of the bonus experience. For example, collecting three gold coin symbols during base gameplay could launch a mini-game. Spinning a wheel in the bonus round allows picking slot reels positions for a chance to win 10 or 25 free spins.

## Number of Free Spins Awarded 

### Varying Amounts
The number of free spins awarded depends entirely on the game design. Some only offer 5 spins while very generous games may give out 50 or 100 spins. Typically, games that require five scatters will award more spins than three scatter bonuses. Casino games aim to provide enough free spins to feel exciting while limiting extreme jackpot wins for the house.

## Additional Features

### Multipliers 
Many free spin bonuses assign a multiplier like 2x, 3x or 5x to maximize earning potential. This multiplier applies to all regular and bonus symbol wins throughout free spins. Even modest wins are amplified, and large wins mean the chance at life-changing payouts. Multipliers substantially improve the value and fun factor of free spin promotions.

### Retriggering Bonus
Additional special symbols placed on reels may retrigger free spins if landed on during bonus spins. For example, three Scatters could provide another 10 spins. This extends excitement and eliminates the disappointment of bonuses ending quickly. With luck and skill, free spins can cascade into much longer bonus rounds worth considerable prizes through retractions. 

### Special Symbols or Features
Developers work to stack the deck in player favor during free spins. Symbols may expand to fill reels for a block or two. Extra wilds or bonus symbols appear with frequency to generate winning combinations frequently. Various mechanics aim to deliver more generous results from free spins and keep players entertained and hopeful of a major payout.

## Handling Wins

### Crediting Real Winnings  
While free spins do not require an initial wager, all monetary wins are real and paid directly to the player's cash balance. Wins are not revoked as bonuses often are with other slot promotions and rewards. Players keep everything they earn, motivating engagement with generous free spins offers.

### Wagering Requirements
Some online casinos require winning amounts from free spins and associated bonuses to be wagered or rolled over a set number of times before cashing out. This ensures the player interacts with other eligible games and provides revenue opportunities for the operator. Examples include a 25x rollover to withdraw bonuses and free spin earnings.

## Restrictions

### Slot Game Limitations
Free spin offers and eligible games specify restrictions. Spins typically apply only to slots or video poker and not table games like blackjack or roulette. Players need to understand and choose from eligible machines for free spins to activate properly. 

### Expiration Timeframes  
Casinos set deadlines to complete bonus rollover requirements or face forfeiting unused bonus amounts. Unused free spins may expire within a week, so players need awareness of such limitations to fully benefit from promotional offers.

# Conclusion

Free spins provide an exciting element of chance and opportunity for slot players. Understanding how different games trigger bonuses and optimize features like multipliers allows maximizing free spin potential. While subject to some restrictions common with online slot bonuses, real cash wins motivate engagement in this popular promotional format. Overall, free spins deliver memorable bonus gameplay and chances at life-changing jackpots for minimal investment.
