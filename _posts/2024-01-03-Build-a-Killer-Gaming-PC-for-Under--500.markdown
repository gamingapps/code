### How It's Possible 
 
Building a capable gaming PC for under $500 used to seem impossible, but thanks to optimizations in game engines and hardware prices falling over time, it's now achievable with some savvy shopping. In this guide, I'll outline the specific components you can buy new or used to put together a budget gaming PC capable of playing modern titles at high settings. By choosing value-oriented parts and leveraging sales, you don't have to compromise on performance to stay under a $500 budget.

### Introduction  

With some patience and timing purchases around sales, I was able to put together a parts list for a gaming PC costing just under $500 after rebates and including Windows 10. The selected components provide strong 1080p gaming performance without unnecessary bells and whistles. Emphasis is placed on value through deals, used parts where appropriate, and choosing upgradable components that can boost performance further down the road as budgets allow. Let's breakdown the parts list.

### The CPU and Motherboard
 
At the heart of any PC is the CPU and motherboard. For a $500 budget build, the Intel Pentium G4560 dual-core processor is an excellent choice at just $65. Despite only having two cores, the G4560 delivers strong single-threaded performance that keeps it relevant for gaming. Paired with an inexpensive H110 chipset motherboard around $50, you have an upgradable platform that can later support more powerful CPUs like Intel's Core i3 or i5 series. The motherboard I chose has four memory slots, six SATA ports, HDMI and DVI-D video outputs for under $50.
 
### The Graphics Card
 
For a budget gaming PC, spending over half the budget on a discrete graphics card is ideal. The PowerColor Red Dragon RX 480 4GB regularly dips to $140-180 on sale and comes bundled with the critically acclaimed DOOM game. Selling the DOOM code offsets a good chunk of the card's cost. The RX 480 provides smooth 1080p gaming at high to maximum settings in most modern titles released in the last 2 years. It also supports the latest technologies like DirectX 12 and Vulkan which improve performance. Being able to max out new releases on such a low budget is impressive.

### Memory, Storage and Drives
 
8GB of DDR4 RAM in a 2x4GB kit can usually be found for around $40 and provides enough memory for gaming. An 120GB solid state drive (SSD) between $30-45 is chosen as the boot drive to make Windows feel fast and responsive. A 1TB 7200RPM hard disk drive (HDD) rounding out at $45 provides bulk storage space for games, files and more. Good storage setups like this keep load times low without making compromises on capacity.
  
### Reliable Power and Casing
  
To safely deliver power to all the components, I chose a 500W 80+ bronze certified power supply from an established brand like EVGA, Corsair or SeaSonic for around $45. The energy efficiency rating ensures it won't drive up electricity costs over time either. For the PC case, a simple micro-ATX tower like the DIYPC Solo-T2 offers plenty of space for under $30. Together these keep things safely housed and powered.
  
### Assembly and Performance Testing
 
Assembling all the components is straightforward following a video guide and should take only a few hours for someone doing their first build. Using benchmarking tools like 3DMark and in-game benchmarks, I tested the system's performance. To my surprise, it easily runs most modern AAA titles at high to max settings 1080p above 60fps, outperforming current-gen consoles for a fraction of the price. Even some lighter 1440p gaming was playable with compromised settings. Overall the budget build exceeded expectations.

### Room for Upgrades
 
The beauty of a budget build like this is there's plenty of room to incrementally upgrade parts over time to boost performance further. Options to consider include upgrading the CPU to an i3 or pentium G4560 equivalent, adding more RAM, upgrading the SSD or HDD for more storage, or swapping the RX 480 for a newer mid-range graphics card 1-2 years down the line. This extends the usable lifetime of the system for several years of high-quality 1080p gaming on a tight budget.
 
### Conclusion

In summary, this guide proves with smart shopping and timing purchases to sales, a capable budget gaming PC can definitely be built for well under $500 without needing to make compromises in components or performance. Gamers who felt priced out of PC gaming now have an accessible entry point to join the platform and start upgrading their rig piece by piece over time. With optimization and prices trending downward, sub-$500 capable gaming is here to stay.
