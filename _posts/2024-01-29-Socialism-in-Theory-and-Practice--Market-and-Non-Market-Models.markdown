### Defining Socialism  
Socialism refers to economic and political philosophies that advocate for social ownership, democratic control, and fulfillment of basic needs rather than profit-motives. Broadly, there are two conceptions - traditional non-market socialism and market socialism. Non-market socialism advocates for centralized planning while market socialism incorporates market mechanisms.

### Traditional Non-Market Socialist Models
Non-market socialist models attempted central planning in the former Soviet Union, Eastern Europe and some other nations. The "economic calculation problem" made rational decentralized planning impossible without price signals from markets. This led to widespread inefficiencies like shortages. Ultimately, the lack of competition and market signals caused economic failures.

### Market Socialist Models   
Early socialist theorists proposed market socialist models incorporating worker cooperatives and social ownership competing in free markets. Contemporary models aim to eliminate exploitation through social ownership while retaining markets to efficiently allocate capital and resources. Worker cooperatives would compete for resources and consumers in free markets.

### Mixed Economies and Social Democracy
Scandinavian nations combine extensive welfare states with regulated capitalism. However, they are not truly socialist as private ownership of businesses remains. These "mixed economies" represent social democratic capitalism rather than socialism as the means of production are not socially owned or democratically controlled by workers. 

### China's Socialist Market Economy
China blends extensive state ownership with growing private ownership guided by the Communist party toward socialism. Large state-owned firms dominate key sectors while private businesses and stock markets expand rapidly. Currently more state capitalist, China represents a transition economy that could potentially evolve into market socialism.

### Criticisms of Socialism  
Critics argue socialism may restrict individual liberties and private property rights. There are also questions around the feasibility of centrally planned economies without market mechanisms to efficiently allocate resources.

### Criticisms of Unfettered Capitalism
Unrestrained free markets tend toward problems like inequality, unemployment, and financial crises. Some argue socialized institutions and democratic economic planning may become necessary as capitalism renders itself obsolete or unsustainable. 

### Is a Middle Ground Possible?
While mixed economies blend public and private models, the underling systems remain predominantly capitalist or socialist. Transitioning economies like China's represent potential "third way" hybrid systems, though dynamics remain state capitalist currently. More research is needed into feasible hybrid systems.

### Defining a Functional Society
There are open questions around prioritizing profits versus well-being, efficiency versus equality, and how systems can balance these and other societal goals. Overall the debate centers on defining the characteristics of a just, stable and broadly prosperous society.
