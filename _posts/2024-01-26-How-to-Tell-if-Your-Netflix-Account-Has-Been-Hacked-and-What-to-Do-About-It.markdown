## Introduction
Netflix has become one of the most popular streaming services in the world, with over 200 million subscribers enjoying thousands of movies and TV shows at their fingertips. However, as with any popular online account, Netflix profiles aren't immune to the threat of hacking. With so much personal and financial data attached to these accounts, it's important for subscribers to be aware of the signs of a compromised login and how to regain control. This post will outline the key things to check and steps to take if you suspect your Netflix profile has fallen prey to an unauthorized user.

### Check Viewing Activity For Clues
The first place to look for signs of unauthorized access is within your own viewing history. Launch the "Account" option from your profile page and navigate to the "Viewing Activity" section. Here you'll find a record of titles that have recently been watched using your login credentials. Take a moment to review the listings for anything you did not personally watch. Hackers may also try deleting activity logs, so an empty history isn't definitive proof either way. Still, checking for unfamiliar content is a good starting security check.

## Examine Recent Device Streaming Settings 
Another useful accountability feature offered by Netflix is the ability to see all devices that have recently streamed content using your account. Under the "Recent Device Streaming" option within your "Account" page, look for any locations listed that seem out of place or unfamiliar to you. Seeing device names and IP addresses from places you have not visited yourself could indicate someone has accessed your profile without permission. Pay close attention to signs of activity from unknown mobile devices, computers or set top boxes you do not own.

### Change Your Password Immediately
If after reviewing activity and devices you notice anything suspicious, the next important step is to change your Netflix password without delay. Choosing a new, unique passphrase that is difficult to guess helps lock out any unauthorized users and prevent future hacking attempts. Make sure to select a strong mix of upper and lowercase letters, numbers and symbols that you have not used anywhere else online. Once changed, your new login credentials will automatically log out any other devices currently using your profile without your knowledge or consent.

## Log Out Of All Devices  
For an added layer of security beyond just a new password, Netflix lets subscribers remotely "Sign out of all devices" currently linked to their account. Within the "Account" settings menu, selecting this option signs off any other profiles logged in without your awareness. This ensures no lingering access from devices you did not personally authorize. It's a good idea to routinely purge leftover logins, especially following a suspected or confirmed hacking incident.

### Beware Of Phishing Scams And Weak Passwords
So how did hackers initially gain access if your Netflix login was compromised? All too often it involves social engineering tricks or insecure online behaviors. Phishing scams - fake emails, texts or websites designed to steal passwords - are one of the main ways cybercriminals obtain login credentials for important accounts. Be wary of unsolicited messages asking for sensitive details. Another vulnerability is password reuse across multiple profiles. Choosing strong, unique passwords and avoiding using the same one in multiple places greatly reduces risk of a hack enabled by a breach elsewhere.

## Review Linked Accounts And Settings
If hackers got ahold of your Netflix login, it's possible they also gained access to any other profiles connected through integrated login options. Within your Netflix "Account" settings, check if your profile is linked to additional services like your primary email inbox or Facebook profile. If so, immediately change passwords on any associated accounts using the same or similar credentials as Netflix. Also review all account privacy and security options to ensure no new devices or permissions have been unexpectedly added without your knowledge. 

### Consider Using A Password Manager
Creating and remembering strong, unique passwords for every online account can be challenging to keep track of, making password reuse almost inevitable for some. Using a reliable password manager solution can help remove this vulnerability. Password managers automatically generate random strings of letters, numbers and symbols for all your logins and securely store them in an encrypted digital vault accessible by a single master password. This approach provides a much higher level of account protection against hacking compared to reusing mundane passwords across multiple profiles.

## Contact Netflix Support If Needed
If after thorough checks you verify unauthorized access occurred on your Netflix account, don't hesitate to directly inform their customer support team for help. Explain the situation calmly and provide evidence uncovered of the hacking incident if available. Netflix takes account security very seriously and representative can assist by temporarily freezing the profile, requiring password resets on linked services, or taking additional security measures as needed. With their involvement, subscribers can work to fully regain control and prevent future unauthorized streaming.

In summary, staying vigilant about account security, closely monitoring activity and devices, using strong unique passwords, and contacting support promptly about suspected intrusions are key steps Netflix users can take to defend against unwanted third party access. With a little diligence, subscribers can continue enjoying all their favorite movies and TV shows safely and securely through the service.
