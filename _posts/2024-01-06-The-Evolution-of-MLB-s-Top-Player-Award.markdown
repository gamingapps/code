### A Brief History
The Sporting News MLB Player of the Year Award has been awarded annually since 1936 to recognize the player deemed to have had the most outstanding regular season in Major League Baseball. Some of the earliest winners included Joe DiMaggio, Ted Williams, and Stan Musial in the 1940s and 1950s who dominated their eras. The award helped define the best individual player each season.

### Albert Pujols's Three-Peat
Albert Pujols established himself as one of the greatest sluggers of all time by winning the award in 2003, 2008, and 2009 with the St. Louis Cardinals. In 2003, he slashed .359/.435/.728 with 47 home runs and 124 RBIs. Pujols followed that up with a 37 home run, 116 RBI season in 2008. And in 2009, he smashed his way to a line of .327/.420/.658 with 47 homers and 135 RBIs cementing himself as the best player of his generation. While now in decline with the Angels, Pujols' three-year reign remained one of the most impressive in award history.

### Bonds and A-Rod's Steroid-Fueled Runs
Just as impressive on the surface were Barry Bonds' and Alex Rodriguez's runs at the top from 2001-2004. Bonds won three straight from 2001-2002 shattering the single season home run record. A-Rod captured awards in 2003 and 2005. However, both players' accomplishments came during baseball's Steroid Era, casting a shadow over what were truly unbelievable numbers. Bonds famously smashed 73 home runs in 2001 while Rodriguez put up monster seasons for the Rangers. Their prolific play redefined what was possible but also reflected how performance-enhancing drugs were warping the game.

### Ted Williams's Unmatched Excellence  
While active in an earlier era without enhanced accusations, Ted Williams established himself as the greatest hitter in baseball history by winning the award an unmatched five times between 1946-1958 with the Red Sox. Nicknamed "Teddy Ballgame," he won the Triple Crown twice and boasted a career .344 average and slugging percentage of .634 during baseball's Golden Age. Williams embodied pure hitting talent the likes of which have never been seen before or since. By taking the award five times over his Hall of Fame career marked Williams as the standard by which all players should be measured.

### More Multiple Winners Emerge
As the award evolved through the 1960s and 1970s, new stars began to shine consistently bright enough to win it more than once. Cincinnati Reds second baseman Joe Morgan took home back-to-back honors in 1972-1973. And in the late 2000s and early 2010s, Detroit Tigers slugger Miguel Cabrera joined the multi-time winners club by claiming the award in 2012 and 2013 while living up to his "Miggy" nickname with prodigious power and batting prowess. Cabrera and Morgan proved that dominance over multiple seasons could lead to multiple Sports Illustrated Player of the Year Awards.

### A Running List of One-Time Winners
Throughout the award's history, most winners only captured it once thanks to baseball's parity and year-to-year fluctuations in player performances and team success. A running list of these one-time award takers spans several decades and includes legends like Stan Musial, Willie Mays, Reggie Jackson, Cal Ripken Jr., and Albert Pujols among many others. Winning the award in a single season demonstrated the tremendous individual campaign turned in but did not always translate to long-term or repeated greatness at the game's highest level.

### deGrom's 2018 Campaign
In recent years, one standout one-time winner has been New York Mets phenom Jacob deGrom. In 2018, he put together a season for the ages with a 1.70 ERA over 217 innings pitched. However, playing for a disappointing Mets team, deGrom received almost no run support, leading to a paltry 10-9 won-loss record. Still, advanced metrics like his NL-best 1.68 Fielding Independent Pitching made it clear that deGrom was the most individually dominant pitcher in baseball that year. His 2018 campaign showed that in the analytically-inclined modern game, gaudy traditional stats like pitcher wins mattered less than those reflecting true performance.

### New Views of Pitcher Wins and Losses 
DeGrom's 2018 award-winning season reflected the evolving understanding across MLB that the antiquated pitching win statistic is not only a team-dependent measure but also a poor indicator of how effective a hurler actually was any given outing or year. New sabermetric pillars like ERA, FIP, xFIP that don't rely on team run support have rightfully taken center stage. As such, modern aces can post award-worthy campaigns even without a high traditional win total thanks to better reflecting their elite individual pitching impact. This new lens has helped reshape evaluations of pitcher value and performance.

### Ohtani Opens Doors for Two-Way Stars
With his unprecedented two-way success as both a stellar pitcher and feared hitter since coming to the Majors with the Angels in 2018, Shohei Ohtani has started to break down barriers that once strictly separated the pitching and hitting aspects of the game. By demonstrating it is possible to excel at both at the game's highest level, albeit in a part-time, workload managed role, Ohtani may have opened the door for more Rule 5 Draft exceptions and opportunities for multi-talented players in the future. How future Player of the Year Awards may recognize and reflect two-way achievements remains to be seen, but Ohtani has started changing perceptions of what one player can accomplish on a baseball field.
