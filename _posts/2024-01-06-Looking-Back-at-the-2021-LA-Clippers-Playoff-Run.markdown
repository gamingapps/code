### The Clippers Topple the Top-seeded Jazz

The LA Clippers began their 2021 playoff journey in the second round facing the top-seeded Utah Jazz. Though they entered the series as underdogs after losing Kawhi Leonard to injury, the Clippers displayed tremendous resilience. Led by Paul George's masterful playmaking and scoring, LA took the series in six hard-fought games. George averaged over 30 points per game to fill the void left by Leonard's absence. Role players like Reggie Jackson and Nicolas Batum also stepped up in crucial moments. By defeating the league's best regular season team missing their superstar, the Clippers shocked the NBA world and punched their ticket to their first-ever Western Conference Finals.

### A Formidable Foe Awaits in the Suns 

Advancing past the Jazz was an impressive feat, but an even tougher challenge loomed in the Conference Finals against the Phoenix Suns. Phoenix had finished with the second-best record in the league and boasted a deep, balanced roster led by All-Star Devin Booker. Many experts predicted the young, athletic Suns would prove too much for the Clippers without Kawhi. However, LA had defied expectations before against Utah. With Paul George playing like an MVP and key veterans like Marcus Morris and Reggie Jackson continuing to produce, the Clippers felt they had enough firepower to take down Phoenix as well.

### A Star-Studded Roster Built for Title Contention

Entering the 2021 postseason, the LA Clippers boasted a roster seemingly loaded for a championship run. In Kawhi Leonard and Paul George, they had two of the best two-way players in the NBA who had led the team to intense playoff series victories in previous years. Around their superstar duo, GM Lawrence Frank had assembled a supporting cast with depth, versatility and playoff experience. Key veterans like Marcus Morris, Reggie Jackson, Nicolas Batum and Ivica Zubac complemented the stars perfectly. On paper, this Clippers roster appeared to be one of if not the most talented in franchise history.

### Question Marks Emerge About Doc Rivers' Strategies

While the Clippers roster was undeniably talented, cracks began to emerge in their foundation as the playoffs progressed. Though head coach Doc Rivers had led them to success before, his strategies and in-game adjustments came under more scrutiny. LA struggled down the stretch in close games, struggling to execute in crunch time situations. Question marks arose about Rivers' lack of offensive creativity and disciplined defensive schemes. Despite the star power on the court, the Clippers seemingly lacked direction at critical junctures. Rivers' job was safe due to past accomplishments, but he would bear much of the blame if LA fell short of the finals.

### Paul George Ascends as Kawhi Sits

With Kawhi Leonard sidelined for the entirety of the second round against Utah, all eyes turned to Paul George. Though he had struggled in prior playoff disappointment, PG13 answered the call magnificently. Averaging over 30 points, 10 rebounds and 5 assists per game, George took complete control of games offensively while still defending at an elite level. The Clippers' championship aspirations seemed sunk without Kawhi, but George responded like a bonafide superstar to lead LA to victory. His masterful two-way play reaffirmed why the Clippers trusted him as their co-star, as he stepped up immensely in his teammate's absence.

### A Hard-Fought Series Against a Rising Phoenix Squad

Moving to the Conference Finals, things continued to get tougher for LA as they matched up with the surprising Suns. Devin Booker was having a breakout playoffs and Chris Paul was leading the young Phoenix core brilliantly. In the series opener, the Clippers battled from a double-digit deficit late to steal a narrow win. More tightly contested games followed with both teams fighting tooth and nail. While Phoenix had homecourt advantage, LA wasn't going to bow out easily. Paul George and Reggie Jackson upped their production against a tough Suns defense to keep the series close. After six games of back-and-forth action, the series went the distance with the Suns finally prevailing.

### Injuries Prove Costly Despite Immense Talent

Despite assembling arguably the greatest collection of talent in franchise history, injuries repeatedly hampered the Clippers' championship potential. Kawhi Leonard was sidelined for 9 crucial playoff games, missing the entire second round against Utah. Starters like Serge Ibaka were lost for the year as well. Role players like Patrick Beverley also suffered injuries at inopportune times. While LA showed heart competing without stars, playing at full strength seems necessary for a deep playoff run. With so many crucial cogs in and out of the lineup, it was difficult for the team to develop chemistry or maintain momentum. Fully healthy, this Clippers roster may have achieved even more.

### A Bright Future Still Awaits in LA

While falling just short of the ultimate goal of an NBA title, the 2021 season still represented a period of growth and achievement for the LA Clippers organization. Making their first-ever Conference Finals appearance was a franchise milestone and source of pride. With Kawhi Leonard and Paul George under long-term contracts and entering their basketball primes, the Clippers remain loaded with two perennial All-NBA talents leading the way. The franchise has established a winning culture of competing for championships on a yearly basis. If able to avoid the injury misfortunes of 2021 and further develop chemistry together, LA's title prospects look bright for years to come.

### Taking Pride Despite Finals Absence

Despite falling three wins short of the NBA Finals, Clipper fans and the organization still took immense pride in the team's accomplishments in 2021. Advancing past the top-seeded Jazz without Kawhi Leonard was one of the more shocking upsets in recent playoff memory. LA competed valiantly against a very good Suns squad, pushing the series to six games while missing their second superstar as well. The franchise reached new heights by making their first Conference Finals in franchise history. While falling prey to injuries hampered title dreams, beating expectations and cementing themselves among the NBA's elite brought Clipper Nation glory during a season they'll never forget.
