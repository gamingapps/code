### Draft Mistakes Cost Them Superstar Talent

The Pacers have made some costly mistakes over the years in the NBA draft. In 2015, they selected Myles Turner over future All-Star guard Devin Booker. Booker has blossomed into a perennial All-Star for the Suns while Turner has yet to make an All-Star team for the Pacers. Another blunder was in 2011 when they swapped Kawhi Leonard for George Hill on draft night. Leonard went on to help the Spurs win multiple titles while Hill had a short, underwhelming stint with the Pacers. They also took TJ Leaf over the budding star John Collins in 2017. Collins is now an elite rebounder and scorer for the Hawks.

### Alternate History of Pacers Roster 

Imagine if the Pacers had drafted Booker, kept Leonard, and selected Collins. Their starting lineup could have looked like Booker at point guard, Paul George at shooting guard, Kawhi Leonard at small forward, John Collins at power forward, and Serge Ibaka at center. That group would instantly give the Pacers one of the most talented rosters in the league with the potential for deep playoff runs for years.

### 1995-96 Pacers: A Strong Squad That Underperformed

Led by Reggie Miller, Rik Smits, and the Davis twins (Dale and Antonio), the 1995-96 Pacers team had a top-10 offense and defense in the league that season according statistical rankings. However, they underachieved in the playoffs by losing in the first round to the 8th-seeded Atlanta Hawks. That Pacers squad had the talent to make a serious title challenge but fell short of expectations.

### 1982-83 Pacers Had Worst Record in Franchise History

Going just 20-62, the 1982-83 Pacers team finished with the fewest wins in franchise history since joining the NBA in 1976. It marked the start of terrible stretch for the Pacers during the 1980s as they struggled to win on a consistent basis. They failed to reach .500 for the entire decade and had losing records in 9 out of 10 seasons from 1980 to 1989.

### Victor Oladipo Trade Mixed Results for Both Sides

The Pacers trading Victor Oladipo to Houston in early 2021 reunited him with former Pacers teammate and current Rocket John Wall. For Indiana, they received Caris LeVert who they hope can take on a leading scoring role this season. It's been a mutually-beneficial trade so far as both teams got players that better fit their timeline and needs.

### Conley Could Provide Veteran Leadership to Pacers 

After losing starting point guard Darren Collison to retirement in 2019, the Pacers have struggled to find consistency at the position. Veteran Mike Conley could fill that void with his scoring, playmaking, and leadership skills. Entering his 15th NBA season, Conley has playoff experience and could help stabilize the Pacers backcourt as they build around their young core.

### Franchise Icons and Retired Jerseys

The Pacers have retired jerseys honoring some of their all-time greats, including power forwards George McGinnis and Mel Daniels, guard Roger Brown, and coach Bob "Slick" Leonard who won championships with the franchise in the ABA. Reggie Miller is also immortalized for his Hall of Fame career spent entirely with the blue and gold. These players and coaches left an indelible mark on Pacers basketball.

### Fort Wayne Mad Ants Serve as G-League Affiliate

Since 2015, the Pacers have directly affiliated with the Fort Wayne Mad Ants of the NBA G League, forming a one-to-one partnership. This allows Indiana to assign younger players and assignees to get valuable developmental minutes against NBA-caliber competition. Players like T.J. Warren, Davion Mitchell, and Duane Washington Jr. all benefitted from time with the Mad Ants before earning roles with the Pacers.

### Malice in the Palace Still Stains Franchise History 

The infamous "Malice at the Palace" brawl between players and fans during a 2004 game against the Detroit Pistons still overshadows what was otherwise one of the Pacers' most successful periods. Led by Reggie Miller and Ron Artest, they were contenders but that ugly incident damaged the reputations of those involved for a long time. It's a dark moment that Pacers fans would love to forget.
