## Introduction 
AI technology has advanced rapidly in recent years, bringing powerful creative tools within reach of many. However, unauthorized access threatens ongoing progress. This post explores ethical and supported use of AI platforms while respecting each tool's terms of service.

### Overview of Key AI Platforms
Leonardo AI and Midjourney are leading generative AI tools that use deep learning to produce images from text prompts. They have developed advanced techniques through significant investment but require ongoing funding to deliver value to users. While capabilities continue expanding, responsible use means respecting access guidelines.

### Revenue Supports Continued Advancement  
Both Midjourney and Leonardo AI rely on paid subscriptions to fuel further research. One-time donations or limited free trials cannot sustain the large teams and computing infrastructure needed. Spending reasonably supports developers delivering even more impressive results in the future through regular updates. 

### Free Access Hurts Innovation in the Long Run
While the temptation exists to use powerful AI indefinitely without contributing, that mindset jeopardizes future progress. As with any creative work, maintaining top-tier generative platforms requires extensive resources. Users benefit most by following authorized procedures that keep talent and technology advancing.

### Ethical Use Upholds Terms of Service
Each tool publishes terms outlining appropriate and inappropriate uses. Violating policies through unpaid or fraudulent access could result in banned accounts or other penalties. Most wish to explore possibilities responsibly within stated boundaries that protect copyrights and prevent harmful manipulations.

### Alternative Options for Various Needs
Not all needs warrant a full subscription, so exploring available free trials, student/non-profit discounts or open-source alternatives makes sense. Other paid tools also exist at lower price points for occasional use or limited means. Researching full options helps application of AI align with individual circumstances. 

### Stylar AI - A Creative Free Option  
For lightweight design, illustrations or social posts, Stylar AI generates uniquely styled text and images without charge. It offers a simple way to add visual interest experimentally without vast resources. Its restrictions suit testing artistic bounds before deciding on investment.

### Look Beyond Top Platforms  
Lesser known but still capable tools may provide alternative free access through different business models like optional donations. With effort, free yet legitimate creative AI can potentially surface for certain modest uses if guidelines are clear and uncompromising quality remains.

### Support Further Progress Through Proper Means
Use of generative AI platforms as their designers intend shows good faith, respect and encouragement for those enabling new frontiers. This solidarity helps more users over time benefit from continual technical boosts and expanded creative horizons that funding makes possible. Upholding terms cultivates community.

### Answers for Ethical Exploration 
Questions about any program's policies are usually best asked directly to their teams. With an open and understanding mindset, many avenues could exist to experience AI's growing wonders through responsible cooperation instead of unjust taking without reciprocation that stagnates works for all.
