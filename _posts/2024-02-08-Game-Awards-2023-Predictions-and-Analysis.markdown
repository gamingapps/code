## Baldur's Gate 3 Sweeps Awards in 2022
Baldur's Gate 3 had a major victory at the 2022 Game Awards taking home six prestigious awards including Best RPG and Best Performance. The critically acclaimed role-playing game from Larian Studios had been in early access for years wowing fans with its expansive fantasy world. Accepting the awards, the developers at Larian expressed gratitude for the support of players who helped shape the game into the masterpiece it became. Baldur's Gate 3's awards sweep showed that patience and commitment to quality can result in widespread recognition.

## 2023 Nominees Announced  
Early this year the nominees for the 2023 Game Awards ceremony were revealed kicking off debate among fans and analysts. Major titles like Alan Wake 2, Baldur's Gate 3, Marvel's Spider-Man 2, Resident Evil 4, Super Mario Bros. Wonder, and The Legend of Zelda: Tears of the Kingdom received nominations. Marvel fans rejoiced at Spider-Man 2's nod celebrating the company's growing video game output. However, most agreed Baldur's Gate 3 would be the front-runner after it dominated 2022. 

## Baldur's Gate 3 or Tears of the Kingdom?
While Spider-Man 2 isn't seen as a serious threat, the two games generating the most hype as potential winners are Baldur's Gate 3 and Tears of the Kingdom. Both earned widespread praise from critics and players alike. However, Tears of the Kingdom concludes the groundbreaking Breath of the Wild storyline giving it an emotional edge. But Baldur's Gate 3's sweep last year shows past accolades aren't destiny. This neck-and-neck race will likely go down to the wire.

### Surprise Contender - Alan Wake 2?   
Despite taking multiple awards for its category last year, some analysts identify Alan Wake 2 as a dark horse that could shock the industry. Its masterful storytelling, atmospheric world, and creative direction sparked discussion it deserved more recognition. However, it faces an uphill battle against juggernauts like Baldur's Gate 3 and Zelda which have exponentially larger fan bases. For Alan Wake 2 to steal the big prize, it must outshine these beloved series at their peak.

### God of War Ragnarok in 2022 or 2023?
There is ongoing debate around if last year was God of War Ragnarok's chance to win big or if 2023 would have served it better. As one of the most acclaimed games ever, many felt it was overlooked due to its late 2022 launch. While Ragnarok is a certified masterpiece, Elden Ring's all-encompassing appeal made it difficult to surpass. With more time to settle, Ragnarok's place in gaming history may grow even larger though it now misses its shot at awards recognition.

### Industry Bias or True Deserving Winners?
A minority argue the Game Awards favorites are driven more by insider politics than merit. Some claimed Western developers disliked Elden Ring and Horizon's Eastern influences while praising cinematic American styles like God of War. However, it's undeniable Elden Ring evolved the open-world genre in groundbreaking ways. Baldur's Gate 3 also revived the CRPG for modern audiences showing last year truly recognized games pushing boundaries. This suggests the 2023 nominees deserve praise.

### Other Potential Winners
A few other titles ending major marketing windows could enter the picture. Final Fantasy XVI and Starfield are primed for success if they meet immense fan anticipation. Both franchises inspire passionate dedication. Meanwhile, indie darlings like Stray or Cult of the Lamb demonstrate smaller games with uniqueness may sneak nominations. But most agree Baldur's Gate 3 vs. Tears of the Kingdom will define this year's awards race.

### Predicting the Winner     
Given Baldur's Gate 3's sweep just last year, it enters as the odds-on favorite to repeat. However, Tears of the Kingdom may tap into something transcendent by closing Breath of the Wild's epic saga. Both developer's past work warrants high expectations. With many major holidays releases yet unseen, anything can happen. Regardless, this year promises an intense back-and-forth between two virtuoso studios.

### Looking Forward to 2023          
With the caliber of games constantly improving, accurately predicting the Game of the Year is virtually impossible this early in the season. While speculation and analysis makes awards season engaging, players are wise to simply enjoy great titles however they are recognized. The Game Awards honor developer effort while fostering discussion on the growing importance of video games. Ultimately, what matters most are the meaningful experiences created within each game's virtual worlds.
