### Federal Prisoners Limited to Common Areas
Prisons under the Federal Bureau of Prisons (BOP) do not allow inmates to have personal televisions in their cells. This is due to a long-standing BOP policy that aims to reduce security risks and criminal behavior within federal correctional facilities. Instead, televisions are available for prisoners to watch in common areas like multipurpose rooms, chapels, and libraries. The thinking behind this policy is that communal television viewing encourages positive social interaction between inmates while also making it easier for prison staff to monitor what prisoners are watching.

### State Prisons with More Lenient TV Policies  
State prison systems across the U.S. tend to have more lenient policies regarding inmates owning television sets. In some states such as California and Missouri, approved see-through television models can be purchased by prisoners for their cells. These specially designed TVs with clear plastic casings allow correctional officers to easily monitor what programming inmates are viewing from outside the cell. Additionally, many state prisons offer cable television packages that can be purchased from the in-prison commissary. However, the specific TV channels and packages available varies depending on the individual state department of corrections policies.

### Popular TV Shows for Educational Value
Within common area television rooms at both federal and state prisons, basic local channels are the norm along with a movie channel that screens PG rated films approved for incarcerated audiences. However, some cable channels featuring educational documentaries and programs also tend to be popular among prison inmates. The History Channel, A&E Network, and National Geographic are often cited favorites as their non-fiction shows covering history, science, and current events are seen as providing cultural enrichment. Lengthy documentaries are praised for their ability to immerse viewers and help pass the time productively during long stretches inside prison.

### Communal TVs in Lower Security Facilities  
For minimum and medium security state and federal prisons that house inmates in large dormitory settings rather than individual cells, communal televisions placed in central day rooms are the norm. These large screen TVs are typically left on anywhere from 12 to 16 hours per day, with inmates sharing control of the remote and collectively deciding on programming. Officers note that during high-traffic morning and evening hours, multiple dorm groups may crowd around a single television trying to agree on something enjoyable to watch. This shared television experience, while sometimes contentious, is viewed as a way for prisoners to socially interact and reduce tensions between rival gangs or ethnic groups.

### UK Prisons Provide Cell TVs for a Small Fee
The television policies found in UK correctional facilities place a stronger emphasis on prisoner rehabilitation through leisure activities compared to many US prisons. All cells within the various category B and C prisons operated by Her Majesty's Prison Service are equipped with a small 13 inch television. Inmates have the option to retain use of their cell TV by paying a modest Â£1 weekly rental fee directly out of any wages earned from prison jobs. Only those classified as the highest risk prisoners on a basic behavior level see their television privilege temporarily suspended as a disciplinary sanction for rule violations. This practice aims to incentivize good conduct while still allowing most inmates entertainment to cope with incarceration. 

### Reducing Prison Violence Through Distraction  
A commonly held belief amongst correctional officers and administrators is that providing access to television helps reduce stress, anxiety, and violence within prison walls. When inmates are absorbed watching shows, they are less likely to get into conflicts with each other or act out aggressively towards staff. As a result, the presence of televisions is seen as a "babysitting" mechanism that makes the job of prison officials easier to manage unruly populations. TV is positioned as a calming distraction that helps regulate inmate behavior, especially during times of the day when idleness might otherwise breed troublemaking or predatory tendencies between prisoners.

### Strict Rules on Approved TV Models
For security reasons, federal and state prisons strictly regulate the television sets permitted within their facilities. Only flat screen models with see-through plastic casings are approved for inmate cells due property smuggling risks associated with older bulky TV designs. Additionally, all prison-provided or personally-owned televisions must be compliant with technical lockout features preventing unauthorized channel changes or use as a contraband cell phone. Regular monitoring also oversees the content displayed to ensure only pre-approved cable or antenna channels are viewable according to security protocols. These tight restrictions on television technology are intended prevent criminal plans or gang communications from occurring under the guise recreational programming. 

### Passing Time Through Television
With up to 23 hours spent idle inside prison each day, television provides a primary leisure activity and way for inmates to constructively occupy their minds. Surveys of incarcerated individuals consistently find TV watching ranked as the most popular pastime above reading, correspondence courses, or exercise. In the controlled environment ofcorrectional facilities, the ability to immerse in engaging shows offers a mental "vacation" from the monotony of institutional living. Officers acknowledge countless prisoners who zone out absorbed by programmarathons for 6-8 hours straight as a coping mechanism. Although sedentary, this type of focused television viewing is generallyseen as preferable for control and rehabilitation compared to other risky prisoner behaviors like gambling or preying on weaker cellmates.

### Late Night Blackouts and Content Restrictions
However, not all prisons embrace television's role so readily. Some facilities have faced accusations of exploiting inmate access restrictions for punitive purposes unrelated to security. Complaints of arbitrary channel censoring highlight limitations on cultural exposure. Others report vindictive superintendents who cut power to communal TV rooms precisely at 10pm to intentionally frustrate prisoners and create unrest right before lights out. While safety must come before comfort, such practices stir resentment and do little to further rehabilitation goals if not reasonably justified. A balanced television policy respects both inmate welfare and legitimate correctional interests.

### Conclusion
In conclusion, television holds an important place within America's prisons, both as a privilege earned and a tool for control. While policies differ between facilities and security levels, most correctional systems acknowledge TV's benefits in occupying inmates productively and reducing boredom-fueled trouble. At their best, carefully regulated television access programs support rehabilitation aims of preparing prisoners for prosocial reintegration. However, arbitrary or punitive limits risk undermining such progress by breeding resentment rather than rehabilitation. An equitable medium privileging education over idle distraction continues serving both public safety and human dignity within the challenging environment of the correctional system.
