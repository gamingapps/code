## Introduction 

Diabetes is a serious condition that requires daily management. For those with type 1 diabetes, insulin is essential for survival. Unfortunately, the rising costs of insulin have made it dangerously unaffordable for many Americans. This article outlines existing programs and potential policy solutions that could help expand access to affordable insulin across the country. 

### The High Cost of Insulin

Insulin pricing in the US has skyrocketed in recent decades far beyond the rate of inflation. Common brand name insulins that once cost under $25 now sell for over $250 per vial. This financial burden means some diabetics are forced to ration their insulin or go without it entirely, putting their health and lives at serious risk. No one should have to make such an impossible choice simply because they cannot afford a lifesaving medication.

## Patient Assistance Programs

### Major Manufacturers Offer Free Insulin 

The largest insulin manufacturers like Eli Lilly, Sanofi, and Novo Nordisk offer patient assistance programs (PAPs) providing insulin at no cost to qualifying individuals. Eligibility is based on income and lack of health insurance. Applicants need a prescription and proof of finances, and insulin will be supplied for up to one year through these programs. While not a permanent solution, PAPs currently help many access the insulin they require.

## State Healthcare Programs 

### Medicaid Helps Low-Income Residents 

Most US states have Medicaid programs to improve healthcare access for residents living below certain income thresholds. Medicaid eligibility and coverage varies by location but typically includes prescription drugs. For those qualifying based on finances and meeting additional requirements, insulin and diabetes supplies may be fully or partially covered depending on individual circumstances. Medicaid expansion has undoubtedly helped many diabetics afford necessary treatment and supplies. 

## Free Doctor Samples

### Temporary Relief Until Other Options Kick In

Pharmaceutical manufacturers provide limited quantities of free insulin samples directly to physicians. Doctors are then able to distribute these samples to uninsured patients on a short-term basis, usually lasting one to two months. While a very temporary solution, free samples can tide some over while obtaining financial approval for a longer-term program such as manufacturer patient assistance. Every vial helps during gaps in medication access.

## International Healthcare Models 

### Universal Systems Keep Insulin Affordable 

In countries with universal healthcare models like Canada, the UK, and the Netherlands, prescription medications including insulin are substantially more affordable. Costs for the same insulin products are frequently ten times lower abroad compared to pricing in the US private market. This significant price differential stems from regulations limiting pharmaceutical profits combined with collective bargaining power wielded by government-run health insurers on behalf of all citizens. A restructuring of the American system along similar lines could help rein in insulin costs domestically over the long run.  

## Potential Policy Reforms

### Options to Consider for Permanent Change

Lasting reform is needed to resolve the root causes inflating life-saving drug costs beyond the reach of many. Possibilities include allowing Medicare to directly negotiate prices with manufacturers, ending regulatory monopolies that maintain high list prices, and prohibiting pharmacy benefit managers from profiting off the backs of diabetics in desperate need of treatment. Broader expansions to programs such as Medicaid could fill existing coverage gaps to guarantee every diabetic affordable access to the insulin regimen keeping them alive and productive. While major systemic change takes time, targeted short-term solutions exist today to aid those currently struggling.

## Conclusion 

No person deserves to ration or forgo a potentially life-saving medication simply due to high costs. As a wealthy society, we must ensure all diabetic Americans can properly manage their condition without financial burden. A variety of assistance programs currently offer temporary relief, and advocates continue working towards permanent, comprehensive reform. Until ideal solutions materialize, resources outlined here aim to spread awareness of options available right now to help diabetics most in need of insulin access. Our shared humanity calls us to care for the health of our neighbors however we reasonably can.
