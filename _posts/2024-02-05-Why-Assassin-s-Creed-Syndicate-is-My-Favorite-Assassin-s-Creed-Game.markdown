## Introduction to the Franchise and My Favorite Characters
The Assassin's Creed franchise has spanned over a decade now, introducing players to iconic historical settings and compelling assassin protagonists. From Altair in the Crusades to Ezio's multi-game story set during the Italian Renaissance, each entry spotlighted important eras and famous figures. However, no character arc has stuck with me quite like Ezio Auditore from Assassin's Creed II. His journey from vengeful young man to master assassin as he unravels the conspiracies of the Templars showed incredible character development over the games. Witnessing Ezio navigate the politics and intrigue of late 15th century Italy while embarking on his hidden blade-wielding mission was truly engrossing.  

### Memorable Assassins from Other Games
Other assassins that made their mark include Connor Kenway in Assassin's Creed III, who brought the frontier setting and Native American culture to the franchise during the American Revolution. Arno Dorian's story amidst the French Revolution in Unity provided political drama while Edward Kenway's pirate adventures in the Caribbean seas aboard the Jackdaw in Black Flag delivered swashbuckling open world exploration. More recently, Origins' Bayek stood out for his compelling personal journey of loss and revenge during Ptolemaic Egypt. While each entry spotlighted impressive historical periods and well-crafted protagonists, Syndicate became my personal favorite due to its rich Victorian London setting and memorable twin assassins Jacob and Evie Frye.

## Why AC Syndicate Ranks Highly
Introduced as playable twins instead of a single protagonist, Jacob and Evie Frye brought a fresh dynamic to the Assassin's Creed franchise. Jacob represented the brawler approach focused on open combat and gang warfare. Meanwhile, Evie specialized more in stealth, infiltration and intelligence gathering fitting of an Assassin. Players could seamlessly switch between the siblings to experience missions from differing angles using each character's specialty. This opened up new strategies and encouraged experimentation.  

### Gang Wars and Kidnapping Missions
Syndicate also introduced objectives like participating in London's criminal underworld through gang wars to expand territory. Players racked up kills against enemy gangs and rescued civilians to gain new perks and bonuses. Additionally, unique assassination contracts had players track and kidnapping high profile targets for interrogation. New transport and weapon upgrade systems added further depth. With a scope of chaotic objectives beyond the standard stealth assassination missions, Syndicate delivered one of the most engaging progression and arsenal systems in the franchise at the time.

## The Rich Historical Setting of Victorian London
No Assassin's Creed entry to date has recreated a setting with the scale and vibrancy of 1868 London during the Industrial Revolution. Wandering the bustling streets layered with smog enveloped one in Victorian era atmosphere. Iconic landmarks like Big Ben, Buckingham Palace and art nouveau architecture dotted the cityscape. 

### Famous Figures of the Era
Syndicate brought this dense recreation of London alive further by populating it with some famous historical figures. Players interacted with luminaries like Charles Dickens, arranging protection as he conducted research for future novels. Others included Florence Nightingale helping the sick at a local hospital or competing against circus strongman Charles “Commissar” Pearson in fight club battles. Cameos from real 19th century London characters added authentic flavor.

## The Compelling Story and Missions
At the center of Syndicate's plot was the sinister Templar control over London enforced through crime and corruption. Gang leader Crawford Starrick headed this shadow rule, rigging the industrialization of the city for his own gains. As a new generation of Assassins, siblings Jacob and Evie Frye were tasked with toppling Starrick's regime and liberating the city.

### Unique Brother-Sister Stories
Their interwoven quests delivered diversity, whether sabotaging factories or rescuing child laborers with Evie's stealth or participating in fighting rings with Jacob's brazen combat approach. Players bonded with the twins through their banter and developed affection for London through helping its destitute citizens. Investigating crime scenes Cluedo style and halting public executions were some story highlights. Together the Fryes' campaign against Starrick culminated in a climactic final showdown shaping the future of the Brotherhood.

## Returning to the Franchise's Roots with Stealth
While past entries emphasized different pillars like naval adventures or all-out combat, Syndicate refocused on the stealth mechanics that defined the series. Mechanics like blending into crowds discreetly or losing pursuers by climbing structures allowed for new infiltration strategies.

### Improved Stealth Tools  
NewLAST tools like noise making whistles or ziplines launched from above enabled smooth environmental traversal. Tracking enemies via eagle vision after losing sight created more tension. Non-lethal knockout techniques like wall punches and hidden blade chokes provided options to avoid raising alarms. Gadgets like cloak darts and smoke bombs injected more variety to stealth approaches. These refined systems hearkened back to the stealth-action roots in a refined package.

## The Refined Combat and Parkour
For those seeking open conflicts, Syndicate's combat was tightened into a fluid, impactful martial arts system. Chaining slick dagger combos, counters and finishing moves into brutal gang takedowns felt truly assassin-like. Jacob excelled with brawler moves while Evie fared better as a skirmisher. 

### Parkour and Freerunning
Additionally, the free-flowing parkour and traversal kept pace with such fluid combat. Players glided effortlessly between rapidly climbing, leaping and free-running across the textured cityscapes and industrial areas without losing momentum. Even climbing massive Big Ben and scampering across its faces delivered that perfect sense of controlled danger that defined the series. Overall, Syndicate struck an excellent balance between stealth and action gameplay.

## Memorable Moments and Activities  
Beyond the main story, Syndicate offered unexpected optional missions that created fond memories. From sabotaging child labor, rescuing urchin children added a layer of compassion. Hijacking important cargo shipments disrupted Starrick’s plans while participating in underground fighting tournaments delivered adrenaline pumping brawls.

### Dynamic Events
Additionally, spontaneously occurring events like gang reinforcements arriving during combat or death-defying leaps into the Thames river added dynamism. Chaining dramatic multi-kills against hordes of attackers or shadowing suspects under the gas lamp glow delivered emergent assassin cinema. These unscripted moments amidst the bustle of late 1860s London made the city feel plausibly lived in.

## Revisiting the Franchise with World War I DLC
Post launch, the Jack the Ripper downloadable content expanded the dark underbelly of Victorian London further. But the Children of Eden story introduced Lydia Frye, sister to Jacob and Evie, whose missions were set in a war-torn London forty years later during World War I. 

### Juno's Backstory
This somber 1916 historical timeframe provided a mature perspective on how wars can impact citizens and shaped Juno's elaborate Ancient Civilization backstory even further. Players witnessed firsthand the airship zeppelin bombardments, social upheaval and supernatural Precursor lore that influenced the present day Assassin-Templar conflict. Overall, this expansion deepened Syndicate's narrative scope.

## Conclusion  
Out of all the Assassin's Creed entries across diverse eras, Assassin's Creed Syndicate stands out as my personal favorite due to the compelling sibling protagonists of Jacob and Evie Frye navigating richly detailed late 1860s London. Between the robust open world, balanced stealth-combat systems, memorable historical figures and unscripted emergent moments that occurred, Syndicate delivered an incredibly realized Victorian sandbox. For these reasons, the characters, setting and gameplay loops of Syndicate resonate with me the most in Ubisoft's acclaimed historical franchise.
