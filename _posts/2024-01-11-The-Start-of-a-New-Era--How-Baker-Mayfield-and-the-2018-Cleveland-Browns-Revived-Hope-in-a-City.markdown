### A Franchise Quarterback is Chosen

The Cleveland Browns selected Baker Mayfield with the first overall pick of the 2018 NFL Draft. While Mayfield had immense success at Oklahoma, winning the Heisman Trophy in 2017, some questioned if his undersized frame and fiery personality would translate to the pros. However, Mayfield was determined to prove the doubters wrong.

### Mayfield Takes Command of the Huddle

When starting quarterback Tyrod Taylor went down with an injury in Week 3, Mayfield was thrust into the lineup. In his first career start, he led the Browns to their first win in over two years, a 21-17 victory over the Jets. Mayfield's strong play earned him the starting job for the rest of the season. Though he continued to deal with growing pains as a rookie, he showed flashes of being a franchise cornerstone.  

### A Promise to Cleveland

In Week 6, Mayfield took offense to comments by Bengals linebacker Preston Brown doubting the Browns chances. He promised Cleveland fans a sellout crowd and a win over Cincinnati. Mayfield spent the week tirelessly promoting the matchup on social media. True to his word, FirstEnergy Stadium was packed to capacity on gameday.

### Reverberations of a Resurgence 

Riding the wave of Mayfield's leadership and home crowd support, the Browns dominated the Bengals 38-12. It was their first win over Cincy in over two years and the loudest the stadium had been in a long time. Signs of real progress started to emerge as Cleveland won several more games down the stretch. Behind Mayfield and running back Nick Chubb, the future looked bright.

### A New Sheriff in Town

Mayfield finished his rookie season with over 3,700 yards and 27 touchdowns. While the Browns only mustered 7 wins, the city had hope for the first time in years thanks to their young franchise QB. If Mayfield and company can continue developing, Cleveland fans believe a return to past glory may be on the horizon for the once proud franchise. Under Mayfield's direction, brighter days seem to be ahead.
