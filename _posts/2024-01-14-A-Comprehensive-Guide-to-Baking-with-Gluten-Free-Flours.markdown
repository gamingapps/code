## Understanding gluten-free flour blends  
Gluten-free flour blends aim to mimic all-purpose flour through combining different flours and thickeners like xanthan gum. While not all gluten-free flours are suitable as a direct substitute in recipes, many commercial blends have been formulated for one-for-one substitution in place of wheat. It is still important to read labels carefully to understand how to best utilize each unique flour. Some single ingredient flours may not perform the same on their own.

## Choosing the Right Gluten-Free Flours
When selecting gluten-free flours, it is important to consider both the taste and texture each will impart. Not all flours are created equal - some are denser while others are airier. Sorghum flour bakes most similarly to wheat, but you'll need to adjust amounts depending on the weight of the flour compared to wheat. Factors like whether you're making quick breads, cookies or yeast breads will influence your flour choices. 

## Necessary Binders for Gluten-Free Baking
Without gluten as a structure builder, baked goods may not rise properly. Xanthan gum, guar gum, psyllium husk, chia or flax seed gel are common binders used to simulate gluten's abilities. Eggs can also function as a binder. Incorporating one of these ingredients is key to achieving cakes, breads and treats that closely mimic their wheat-based counterparts.

### Common gluten-free flours 
Here's a breakdown of popular gluten-free flours like sorghum, oat, rice, potato starch, tapioca, flax, almond and coconut. Tips include grinding your own flour at home for freshness and proper storage methods for maintained quality and freshness. Stocks like rice flour are more shelf-stable while nut and seed flours require refrigeration.

### Almond Meal and Flour Explained
While both are made from almonds, almond meal retains more fiber but has a coarser texture compared to silky-smooth almond flour. Learn how to make each at home using a high-powered blender or food processor. The steps for blanching and then drying almonds to create flour are also outlined.

### Adjusting Recipes for Gluten-Free Baking  
Converting wheat flour amounts to accurate gluten-free weights requires charts for comparison. Measuring ingredients by weight results in more consistent recipes across batches. Guidance is offered for adapting typical wheat recipes.

### Best Practices for Gluten-Free Baking
A kitchen scale shouldn't be overlooked when baking gluten-free. Proper flour storage methods help maintain freshness. Washing quinoa and soaking beans are also reviewed. Tips include making your own nut and grain flours at home.

### Assessing Ingredients for Gluten-Free Status
Guidance is given for determining if foods inherently contain gluten through wheat or risk cross-contamination during processing. An example examines how to read labels of instant potato mixes. 

### Alternatives to Common Wheat Products
Gluten-free flours can enhance the taste and texture of wheat-based recipes when blended together thoughtfully. For example, how coconut flour adds moisture to scones. However, replicating wheat fully brings challenges due to its unique proteins. Expected differences in results are acknowledged.
