## An Introduction to Sharing Steam Games
Sharing your Steam games with friends allows everyone to enjoy their favorite games together, even if only one person owns the game. There are a few main ways Steam facilitates sharing titles between friends, including Family Sharing, gifted games, and game bundles. Let's take a closer look at how each method works.

### Enabling Family Sharing  
Family Sharing through Steam allows you to share your entire game library with other Steam users added to your Family Sharing group. Anyone in the group can then download and play the games you own while also enjoying any Steam features like Cloud saves, achievements, and play time tracking. The main caveat is that only one person in the group can actively play a shared title at once. Setting up Family Sharing is simple - just log into Steam, navigate to Settings then Family Sharing, and toggle it on before adding friends.

### Sharing Individual Games
If you want friends to be able to play a specific game you own simultaneously, gifting is the way to go. During checkout on a game's Steam store page, you can choose to purchase it as a gift for another user. Once sent, they'll receive the game in their Steam library to play at will without limiting your access. It's a great personalized way to share without restrictions.

## Easy Refunds for More Sharing
Did you recently purchase a game only to find your friend also wants to play? Steam's generous refund policy offers a workaround. As long as it's been less than two weeks and under two hours of playtime, you can request a refund on a title to then buy it as a gift for your pal. Even after the window, contacting support can sometimes result in an exception refund for re-gifting. 

## Discounted Pairs and Bundles  
Steam frequently offers game packages that bundle multiple titles together at a reduced price. If you own some but not all of the games included, the remaining unduplicated titles can sometimes be sent directly as gifts. Larger bundles may even include an extra tradable/giftable copy of each game for sharing. It's an effective strategy to expand libraries while getting friends involved at a discount.

## The Risks of Account Sharing
As alluring as it may seem, avoiding giving friends direct access to your Steam account is strongly recommended. While well-intentioned at first, shared logins remove security for the original owner and permit the other user full autonomy over the associated library. Should anything negative happen like account theft or community guideline violations, the lending party bears equal responsibility. Built-in sharing alternatives through Family Sharing and gifts avoid this risk.

## Alternative Methods For Offline Co-Op
While Steam delivers the most seamless digital experience, some pre-installed games allow for traditional offline local multiplayer without an internet connection. In these cases, simply copying game files between computers permits friends to play together using the same digital titles. Beware that most games will require authenticating online, limiting widespread sharing. Download managers can help transfer files but often violate Steam's Terms of Service.

## Considerations for Developers 
Default Steam settings prevent sharing through Family Sharing or bundles containing previously owned games. Developers must opt-in to enable these features, or potentially offer additional giftable keys when bundles are purchased. For games dependent on online services or third party DRM, digital sharing may not be possible regardless of Steam configuration. In most cases, traditional gifting, bundles, or sale discounts for multiple copies work best. 

## Recapping Preferred Sharing Methods
To safely and conveniently share Steam games among friends, the best practices involve using Family Sharing, individual game gifting, refunding to re-gift, or taking advantage of bundles including shared titles. Combining multiple approved methods provides the most flexibility depending on specific situations. While account sharing initially seems like a faster option, the security risks to all involved parties far outweigh any short-term benefits. Steam's native tools eliminate that danger while still achieving the goal of cooperative gaming.
