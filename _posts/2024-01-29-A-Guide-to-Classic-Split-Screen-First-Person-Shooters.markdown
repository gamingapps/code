## Nintendo 64 Classics
The Nintendo 64 was truly pioneering for local multiplayer FPS games. GoldenEye 007, released in 1997, introduced 4-player split-screen deathmatch to immense popularity. With tight controls and memorable maps based on the Bond film, it is still regarded as a timeless classic today. The standard "character movement on left stick, aim with right stick" control scheme GoldenEye pioneered is still used widely in FPS games. 

Perfect Dark, released in 2000, improved vastly on the GoldenEye formula. It featured refined gameplay with additional modes, weapons and gadgets. Its single-player campaign was one of the most robust yet seen in an N64 game. But where Perfect Dark really shone was its innovative co-op and versus modes. Playing local deathmatch with friends became an event, as four people crowded around squabbling and cooperating in tense firefights. To this day, Perfect Dark is celebrated as one of the greatest games ever made.

## Multi-Controller Workarounds
Perfect Dark was also pioneering for allowing "angled feet movement" using two controllers simultaneously. This innovative control scheme split character control between the thumbsticks of two controllers. It opened up completely new tactical possibilities for teamplay prior to when dual-analog stick controllers became standard. For those seeking even more options on hardware with technical limitations, resourceful players experimented further with controller workarounds.

### Technical Challenges of Rendering Split-Screen 
Rendering a 3D scene twice simultaneously for split-screen play presents immense computational challenges. Systems must perform all graphics processing for each split view concurrently without any compromise to performance that would impact gameplay. This additional processing load often resulted in lower stable framerates compared to single-player. Developers worked ardently to optimize their game engines and employ techniques maximizing performance within the capabilities of each system's hardware. Efficient split-screen rendering was an artform pushed to its limits.

### Recommended Modern Options
Thankfully several current generation games still support and innovate with local multiplayer and split-screen well. Insurgency offers competitive and realistic tactical FPS gameplay across various modes. The acclaimed Battlefield 1 recreates the massive combined arms conflicts of World War 1 in a way unlike any other. Rainbow Six Siege has become a phenomenon innovating with destructible environments and unique operator abilities in tactical 5v5 defending and attacking. These AAA titles deliver varied and high production value FPS experiences that remain fun to share together in the same living room.

## PC Options are Limited
While consoles saw their heyday of couch co-op FPS games in previous generations, the PC platform has less commonly supported local multiplayer in recent years. This is likely due in part to assumptions of individual monitor and input device use rather than co-op play. Screencheat and newer iterations in the Serious Sam series provide novelty through unique shared perspectives, but options are limited. Gears of War 4 was one commendable exception with its robust split-screen functionality in the PC port. Few developers seem to utilize the potential afforded by multiple high resolution computer monitors and controllers available on the platform to satisfy this multiplayer niche.

## Frames Per Second Basics 
"FPS" is a term that indicates visual smoothness in games but also represents the first person shooter genre. At low frame rates, basic motion may be rendered smoothly enough though fast paced action will be choppy and unresponsive. For optimal control and minimal motion blur, modern standards generally agree 60 or more frames per second (FPS) is ideal for fast FPS gameplay. Higher refresh rate monitors minimize stuttering and tearing that can occur from intermittent dips below the target framerate during intense scenes.

### Components and Bottlenecks
When building a gaming PC, ensuring no single component becomes a bottleneck unduly limiting performance is key to achieving high and stable framerates. Modern quad-core CPUs with 8GB or more system memory help prevent any throttling. A powerful graphics card allowing the latest games to be pushed to the limits of a high-refresh monitor also features prominently. For smoothest results, components are best balanced and upgraded together periodically as new demanding titles emerge.

## Online Play Considerations
For competitive online multiplayer first person shooters, achieving higher framerates grows increasingly important. While visuals may appear reasonably smooth on a typical 60Hz display panel, every additional frame rendered lowers input lag, giving a real advantage. Along with a high refresh monitor, servers running at 120Hz or higher "tick rates" also benefit clients operating above standard refresh rates. The input lag reductions compound to provide a serious edge.

## Nostalgia for the Genre
Though fewer developers focus efforts on it now compared to years past, local multiplayer in FPS games filled an important social gaming niche. The memories of bonding and friendly competition with friends and family gathered around the same TV linger fondly. While technical challenges understandably make split-screen a less common design choice in the modern context, nostalgia persists for revisiting and recapturing magic of those gameplay experiences. Perhaps some future innovative titles can find new ways of delivering on those memories within modern frameworks.
