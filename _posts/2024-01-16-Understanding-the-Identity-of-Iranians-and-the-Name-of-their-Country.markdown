## The Origin of Iran's Name 

Iran's name derives from Middle Persian "Eran" meaning lands of the Aryans. This has been the indigenous name used by Iranians since ancient times, as the name "Persia" is a Greek exonym coming from the name of the Pars province. In 1935, Reza Shah officially asked other nations to use "Iran" when referring to the country internationally, as Iranians prefer their native name.

### Eran Has Been the Indigenous Name 

The name "Eran" or "Iran" has deep historical significance as the self-identifier used by Iranians for millennia. Dating back to ancient times in Old Persian inscriptions, this was the term used to denote their homeland. While outsiders such as the Greeks referred to them as "Persians" based on one province, Iranians themselves called their lands "Eran." In modern times, Reza Shah officially standardized Iran as the internationally recognized name in order to restore this indigenous name.

## Iran's Rich Ethnic Diversity

Iran is remarkably diverse with many ethnic groups collectively forming the Iranian identity. Persians make up the largest at around 60% of the population, with significant minorities including Azeris, Kurds, Lurs, Balochs, Arabs, and more. Each group has immensely contributed to shaping Iran throughout its long continuous history dating back thousands of years. 

### Varied Groups United as Iranians

Despite differences in languages, customs and cultures, all ethnic communities view themselves as Iranian and integral parts that strengthen the fabric of the nation. Their collective efforts helped form one of the world's oldest civilizations. Ethnic Azeris established dynasties that revived the Persian Empire, while Baloch fighters reconquered regions from Arab occupiers. Together the diversity of peoples defines modern Iran and what it means to be Iranian.

## The Distinction Between Persian and Iranian

While often used interchangeably, there is an important distinction between these terms. "Persian" specifically refers to the Persian ethnic group that makes up the majority. Meanwhile, "Iranian" represents the overarching national identity encompassing all citizens of Iran regardless of ethnicity or mother tongue. Both terms can describe people from Iran, but "Iranian" is generally preferred as the all-inclusive demonym.

### More Than Just Persians

Using "Iranian" rather than "Persian" is respectful because it acknowledges the significant non-Persian communities that are just as Iranian. From Azeris who established ruling dynasties, to Kurds with their unique culture in western regions, all have profoundly shaped Iranian civilization. The nuanced difference celebrates Iran's tremendously rich multicultural fabric rather than narrowing the focus only to Persians.

## Variations Among Iranian Languages

While Modern Persian is the official language across Iran, several other Iranian languages are also spoken. Main differences exist between Persian, Dari (Afghan Persian), and Tajik due to geographical separation and outside influences over time. Pronunciation of certain sounds and vocabularies may slightly vary depending on region. 

### Tajiki Most Diverse

Of the Iranian languages, Tajik exhibits the most divergence from Persian. Centuries under Russian rule in Central Asia meant Tajiki absorbed numerous Russian and Turkic loanwords not present in other dialects. Spoken today in both Iran and Tajikistan, it retains the most distinct forms while still mutually intelligible with Persian. However, all Iranian languages descend from a shared origin and linguistic heritage.

## Depictions of Iranians in the Media

Representations of Iranians in Western media and history texts have long obscured the reality of their culture and ethnicity. Ancient Greeks are glorified as pioneers of civilization despite importing many advantages from Iranians, whereas later Iranians are often vilified. However, modern Iranians closely resemble depictions of their ancestors from 2,500 years ago.

### Rejecting Racialization 

Some Iranians claim they are "white" in an attempt to reject the racialization and othering faced for decades, especially since the 1979 revolution. However, this denies Iran's location in Southwest Asia and diversity of ethnicities, many of whom do not fit a narrow definition of white. A better approach is embracing Iranian identities on their own merit rather than viewing it through the lens of outdated racial categories.

## Relations with Neighbors

Iran maintains brotherly relations with its northern neighbor Azerbaijan, as Azeris see themselves as part of the wider Iranian family. Across the region, Iran has good diplomatic and economic ties through mutual interests in stability. However, some propaganda from certain Gulf Arab nations portrays Iranians negatively which Iran rejects as counterproductive to cooperation.

### Friendship Across Borders  

As with any countries, diplomatic approaches with neighbors naturally involve complex considerations. But surveys show Iranian people feel warm affection for their international brethren, especially sharing Iranian heritage and a long shared history. Regional friendship and understanding can easily blossom by looking past artificial divides sewn by those with alternate agendas.

## The Hospitality of Iran

Visiting Iran reveals a modern nation with a well-educated populace, thriving cultural scenes and natural attractions rivaling anywhere. But most memorable are the warmly welcoming Iranian people renowned for their hospitality. Foreign guests frequently leave impressed at the generosity, kindness and hospitality encountered everywhere. This reflects deep-seated Persian values of misafi ("guest-friendship").

### Appreciating Heritage

Iran's diverse cultural monuments, architectural wonders, beautiful mosques and strategic position along the Silk Road leave no doubt of its historical importance. Visitors gain a newfound respect for the continuous Iranian civilization and all its accomplishments. Coupled with hospitable locals and a willingness to share their language and culture, Iran has so much to offer those open-minded enough to experience its treasures firsthand. 

## Conclusion

Iranians strongly prefer their indigenous name which recognizes millennia of continuous identity. As a multiethnic society, all groups define modern Iran and what it means to be Iranian. A balanced understanding celebrates Iran's rich diversity rather than obscuring it through narrow labels. Getting to know ordinary Iranians reveals their culture emphasizes harmony, hospitality and sharing what they treasure most - their heritage. Moving forward, emphasis should remain on advancing cooperation across the region founded on mutual understanding and friendship between neighbors.
