### Stopping the Run is Key
The Patriots consistently ran the ball effectively against the Chiefs defense, gaining over 100 yards on the ground. Establishing the run game opened up more opportunities in the passing game as it helped control the clock. The Chiefs linebackers and defensive line struggled to fill gaps and bring down ball carriers. Controlling clock and tempo through an effective run defense is so important, as the Patriots possessed the ball for long stretches of the game. To shut down opponents' ground attacks, the Chiefs must improve their physicality at the point of attack.

### Adapting the Offensive Scheme
The Patriots offense showed great flexibility in changing plays at the line of scrimmage based on the Chiefs' defensive looks before the snap. Offensive coordinator Josh McDaniels successfully countered many of Kansas City's pre-snap alignments. When the Chiefs failed to make adjustments to New England's varying personnel groupings, their offense became one-dimensional. To find postseason success, the Chiefs need to focus on developing different pre-snap reads and hot route adjustments based on the defense.

### Developing Depth Throughout the Roster  
The Patriots constantly find contributors from players signed as rookie free agents or taken in the late rounds of the draft. Depth is crucial, as injuries exposed a lack of quality backups ready to step up for the Chiefs when needed. New England also consistently develops young players and coaches year after year. To emulate this sustained success, Kansas City must cultivate more homegrown talent and depth through coaching, schemes, and smart contracts for reserve players.

### Paying Attention to Detail in Practice
Practice allows Bill Belichick's teams to perfectly execute specific situations that then occur in games. New England's hard practices simulate game intensity and pressure. The Chiefs need to refocus their practices on fundamentals and replicating in-game situations and downs. Attention to detail and mental preparation are what separates true contenders from pretenders come January.

### Continuous Improvement and Self-Evaluation
Each season, the Patriots thoroughly identify weaknesses and strengths to acknowledge what they must fix. Only by conducting an honest review of what went wrong in playoff losses can the Chiefs take the next step towards sustained success. They must own their flaws and seek out innovation just as New England does to get over the hump.

Continuous improvement, attention to detail, and developing depth are all factors that have kept the Patriots elite for so long. If the Chiefs focus on these areas this offseason, they will be better equipped to dethrone the champions come next January.
