### What is Wolfram Alpha?
Wolfram Alpha is an internet-based computational knowledge engine created by Wolfram Research. Developed by Stephen Wolfram, it incorporates data from expert-curated sources to provide definitive answers to factual queries. It originated from Wolfram's earlier works on computational knowledge, data mining, and semantics. Wolfram Alpha aims to be helpful, harmless, and honest in answering questions submitted to it.

### Examples of Wolfram Alpha's Question Answering Abilities
Wolfram Alpha can understand and solve a wide range of calculation problems within seconds. It supports algebra, calculus, statistics and even domain-specific queries involving physical constants, chemical formulas, units conversions, currency exchange rates and more. Users can enter multi-step equations to be solved, ask "What if" questions by changing variables, and visualize outputs in plots and charts. Examples include computing derivatives, integrals, derivatives, step-by-step solutions to polynomial factoring, and biographies of famous people.

### Checking Math Work with Wolfram Alpha
Many students rely on Wolfram Alpha to verify their understanding by inputting homework problems for step-by-step workings. It is particularly useful for double checking calculus problems involving limits, integrals, and derivatives. Users also enter high-degree polynomial factorizations or complex systems of differential equations for confirmation. Wolfram Alpha helps reinforce learning by replaying the process to catch any mistakes made along the way. This saves time reworking problems from scratch and boosts confidence in final answers.

### Additional Features of Wolfram Alpha Pro
The Wolfram Alpha Pro subscription unlocks powerful computation capabilities. Users can upload datasets and custom code to perform unlimited computations over large data. Outputs can be exported to various formats for incorporation into documents and presentations. plots are interactive with zooming and annotation tools. Other advanced tools include computational notebooks, publishing results online and integrating mobile apps with the desktop version.

### Pricing for Wolfram Alpha Pro
Wolfram Alpha Pro costs $5 per month for individual use on a single device. Students can subscribe for $2 per month. For teams and businesses, packages start from $10 per user per month. Alternatives include an annual subscription at $48 per year (40% off monthly rate). The Wolfram Alpha mobile app is also available on iOS and Android for $2.49 as a one-time purchase with limited functionality compared to the full Pro subscription on desktop.

### Using Mathematica on Raspberry Pi
While Wolfram Alpha is powerful for quick exploratory queries, Wolfram Research also provides the full-fledged Mathematica software. For those wanting deeper computational abilities without large upfront costs, Mathematica can be installed and run for free on Raspberry Pi single-board computers. This gives access to the entire Mathematica programming language, notebooks, and the Wolfram Library Archive right from a small and affordable mini PC.

### Potential Areas for Improvement
While Wolfram Alpha handles a wide variety of questions with exceptional accuracy, there is still room for growth. Areas that could further elevate its question-answering include supporting chemical reaction predictions by name or formula. Providing live data feeds from sources like stock prices, weather or traffic would make the engine more interactive. Improving abilities with large and complex datasets would expand applicable problem domains as well.

### Checking Results for Accuracy
When assessing Wolfram Alpha's outputs, some factors impact potential inaccuracies. External data sources have varying quality and resolution that changes over time. Measurements also improve as science and technology advances. Functions involving non-differentiable points, approximation methods or discrete datasets instead of smooth curves may affect precision. Users are advised to check limiting cases, dimensional analysis and compare to other solution methods where appropriate.

### In Summary
Through its combination of vast curated knowledge and computation power, Wolfram Alpha provides an incredibly useful and impressive question answering service. It has set the bar high as a computational problem solver despite still having untapped potential in some domains. With continued development, Wolfram Alpha has great promise to become an even more capable artificial intelligence able to handle an even broader range of real-world complex queries from a diverse user base.
