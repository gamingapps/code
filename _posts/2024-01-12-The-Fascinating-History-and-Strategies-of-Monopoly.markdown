## The Origins of Monopoly

The game Monopoly was originally created in the early 1900s by Elizabeth Magie. She designed a board game called the Landlord's Game intended to illustrate the negative aspects of concentrating land in private monopolies. The game involved purchasing and trading property and was meant as an educational tool to exemplify economic concepts. 

In the 1920s, Charles Darrow revised and expanded upon the original Landlord's Game idea into what is now recognized as a Monopoly board game and sold it to Parker Brothers in 1935. During World War II, special editions of Monopoly were published with secret messages to help Allied prisoners of war escape. The board games included things like hidden currency that could be covertly exchanged and maps printed on tissue-thin paper concealed in the boards.

## Common Mistakes Made

Many casual players make some common mistakes in how they approach Monopoly games with friends and family. One of the biggest misconceptions is thinking the goal is strictly to accrue wealth and assets on the board rather than strategically bankrupting opponents. Games go much longer if players accumulate wealth without eliminating each other from play. Another common house rule seen is allowing unlimited trading between players freely, when the standard rules actually restrict what can be traded to help end games more decisively.

### Strategies for Property Acquisition

One powerful early strategy is to purchase every property you land on even if you do not have a full color set yet. This quickly builds a real estate portfolio across the board. It also denies opponents the ability to complete sets easily. Another tactic is focusing acquisitions on the cheapest colored properties like the brown and light blue groups in the earliest stages of the game. These provide a solid foundation to build from that is easy to develop fully later on.

### The Advantage of Homes

Maximizing the number of houses placed on properties before upgrading them to hotels is an often overlooked advantage. Upgrading properties one level at a time by adding houses earns more rent each time opponents land as compared to instantly jumping to one solitary hotel. The staggered approach provides a more reliable rental income stream throughout the full course of the game.

### Target the Right Properties  

When looking to develop properties, concentrating on orange, red, and yellow properties is most beneficial. These locations see the most traffic from other players' rolls and pay off frequently. Conversely, avoid over-investing in the purple and green groups, which are rarely landed on during games. It is better to reserve scarce housing for more lucrative color groups.

### Managing the Scarce Resources

Controlling a majority of available houses from the bank is hugely impactful. If you own most of the houses, it severely restricts opponents' ability to develop their own properties and collect higher rents. With limited housing for adversaries to use, it keeps them less competitive for longer. This one change can often swing a game decidedly in your favor from early to mid-game onward. 

## Strategic Interactions and Trades

One element of strategy involves leveraging advantageous trades to manipulate the board layout. Selling incomplete color groups or swapping properties to obtain controlling monopolies can shift the tide of a game. Similarly, offloading extra houses from well-developed properties in exchange for cash reserves empowers further deals and restricts opponents' financial flexibility. Creative packaging in trade deals frequently leads to superior board positioning.

## Maintaining a Flexible Mix

To maintain leverage and adaptable options throughout the full course of a Monopoly match, securing a mixed portfolio of properties across various color groups and price tiers provides more flexibility. This allows customized grouping of property packages to exploit unfolding board scenarios and profit from deals as situations evolve turn by turn. A diversified collection enables capitalizing on changing opportunities.

## Dream Opening Shots 

There are certain rolls early on that provide an enormous boon if they occur. Getting doubles or lucky draws letting a player purchase multiple highly lucrative properties like the orange and red groups in the first circuits around the board can set up dominant monopolies before others have much footholds. Such fortunate starting positions greatly increase chances of an early victory.
