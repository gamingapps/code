### Choosing your class and gifts

When you first start your journey in the Lands Between, you'll need to choose a class. Each class has their own unique starting attributes, weapons and spells. Warrior classes like Vagabond and Hero are good for a more melee focused build, while prophecy and astrologer classes specialize in magic. No matter what you choose, you'll also be able to customize your character further. Be sure to pick your starting gifts wisely too - crafting materials are always useful in the early game. Exploration is key, so take your time learning the basics.

### Exploration is key 

Elden Ring is a massive open world, so exploring every nook and cranny will reward you. Keep an eye out for hidden Sites of Grace that function as checkpoints and warp points. Activating them also levels you up. Along the way, fight enemies to earn runes for leveling up. In combat, dodge and block at the right times. Don't be afraid to run past enemies if an area seems too difficult. Focus on finding weapons, spells and items to make your build stronger before challenging tough bosses.

### Levelling up efficiently

Runes serve as Elden Ring's experience points. Farm runes by clearing out enemy encampments and dungeons. Wisely spend runes on increasing your Vigor, Endurance and the scaling attribute of your main weapon. This makes surviving battles much easier. Ashes of War imbue weapons with elemental damage, status effects and special skills. Applying the right one enhances your damage output based on your build. Investing runes into magic stats opens up powerful spells and sorceries too.

### Early game areas and bosses

Limgrave is the scenic starting zone. Visit sites like the Church of Elleh, Stormhill and the Weeping Peninsula. Tackle dungeons like Stormhill Catacombs and Road Cave early. Your first real test is Margit the Fell Omen. Study his moves and summon Melina for help. Next is Stormveil Castle - carefully navigate its maze-like interior. Godrick the Grafted's second phase can one-shot you, so buff yourself well before engaging this demigod. Stay vigilant, death is always lurking.

### Advancing the mid-game

Head north to the lush Liurnia of the Lakes region. Join the Academy of Raya Lucaria to learn sorceries from master Sorcerer Rogier. In calmer areas, you can summon your spectral steed Torrent to speed across the land. The rot-filled Caelid area contains fearsome foes like the Bell Bearing Hunter. Conquer the Scarlet Rot by defeating Radahn at Redmane Castle. His remembrance unlocks powerful abilities. Progressing the main quest opens new areas to explore.

### Late-game regions 

Climb the Divine Towers dotting the Altus Plateau for spectacular views. Beware of invaders like Tree Sentinels and fire-breathing Magma Wyrms. Deeper underground lie harder enemies like Celebrants and Pumpkin Head enemies. Find the medallions needed to warp to the Mountaintops of the Giants. Trek throughsnowfields while avoidingdeathblight pools. Hunt down Misbegotten warriors in catacombs off the beaten path for rewards. Tougher evergaols yield goodies too. 

### Final bosses and endings

Enter Leyndell, Royal Capital to reach the Elden Throne. Brave its streets filled with vigilant Banished Knights. Defeat Morgott in the sewers. Past Fire Giant lies the Mountaintops' secret - journey to the snowfields' end for a climactic showdown against Godfrey. Beyond lies the Erdtree's sanctuary. The collapsing tree guards secrets. Face off againstRadagon and the Elden Beast. Multiple endings await depending on your actions throughout the story. 

### Post-game and downloadable content

Complete side quests missed earlier or respec your character with Rennala. New Game Plus amps up difficulty while carrying over your build. Fight other Tarnished in jolly co-op or invasions. The Colosseums host PvP combat for rewards. DLC will expand the lore further down the line. Stay tuned for secrets yet unturned in the Lands Between!
