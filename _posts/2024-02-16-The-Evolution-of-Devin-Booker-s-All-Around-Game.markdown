### Early Career Focus on Scoring
Devin Booker entered the NBA known primarily for his scoring ability after a stellar one-and-done career at Kentucky. As a rookie off the bench in 2015, he averaged a modest 13.8 points per game but showed flashes of his offensive brilliance. Over the next few seasons, Booker slowly earned a starting role with the Phoenix Suns and saw his scoring numbers increase each year. By his fourth season in 2018-19, he had firmly established himself as the go-to option on offense, averaging a career-high 26.6 points per game to lead the Suns. While his scoring prowess was never in question, Booker was still focused mainly on putting the ball in the basket during these early years.

### Expanding Role as Passer and Playmaker 
After cementing his role as the Suns' top scoring threat, Booker began displaying improved court vision and playmaking skills. His assist numbers rose from 4.6 per game in 2017-18 to 6.8 the following season as he looked to involve his teammates more. Defenses also started guarding Booker much more closely, which opened up opportunities for his teammates. While still being the primary offensive focal point, Booker seemed more willing to move the ball and create for others rather than forcing his own shot. This expansion of his role on offense started making him a more complete and dynamic player.

### Developing Ball-Handling and Off-Dribble Game
In the 2019 offseason, Booker put in work on improving his ball-handling and strength in the weight room. It started to pay dividends the following season as he added new tricks to his bag, like hesitation moves and crossovers, to handle defenders one-on-one. Booker became adept at beating his man off the dribble or stepping back for tough midrange jumpers when plays broke down. His improved ball skills allowed him create space against set defenses and find the open man when the help arrived. It gave Booker yet another weapon and the ability to orchestrate the offense from the perimeter.

### Reading Defenses at Elite Level    
Through thousands of hours of film study and hard-earned experience over five NBA seasons, Devin Booker has developed an elite-level understanding of defensive schemes and rotations. He recognizes where help is coming from and makes precise passes or takes the best shot available based on the coverage. Booker expertly sets up the Suns' offense and finds ways to exploit cracks in zone or matchup zone defenses. His high basketball IQ is a big reason why he consistently puts up huge scoring numbers so efficiently against varied defensive looks. Booker's cerebral approach makes him a nightmare for opponents to scheme against.

### Scoring From All Areas of the Court
Booker had long established himself as one of the league's most dangerous outside shooters, and his three-point percentages continued climbing each year. But he also expanded his repertoire, making crafty floats and pull-ups from midrange extend his scoring range even further. Around the basket, Booker shows nimble footwork and an array of finishes with either hand, rarely allowing larger defenders to block his shot. Through relentless work expanding his "bag of tricks," Booker has turned himself into a complete offensive weapon threatening opponents from all over the court. There is no spot on the floor where he feels uncomfortable.

### Stepping into a Leadership Role    
As the youngest player ever to lead a team in scoring, Devin Booker always appeared to have the "it factor" of an NBA franchise cornerstone. Now entering his seventh season, he has seamlessly transitioned into a true team leader both vocally and by example. Booker holds his teammates accountable on both ends of the floor, works as hard as anyone, and acts as the ideal professional that the franchise wants their culture built around. He also imparts wisdom and guidance as a mentor to the Suns' younger core. Booker has come into his own as the driving force and face of an organization on the rise in Phoenix.

### Continued Areas of Improvement
While establishing himself as an elite playmaker by any standard, there is still room for Booker to take his playmaking and assist skills to an even higher level. Averaging over 10 assists on any given night is certainly within reach. At the free throw line, knocking down a high-80s percentage indicates his foul-drawing abilities could still be refined. Off the ball, cutting and screening may allow him to further impact winning without using possessions. And on defense, continued growth in awareness and versatility against elite scorers is important as the Suns aim for titles. Booker remains as motivated as ever to work on any perceived weaknesses.

### Booker is Far from Finished Product
Now at the ripe age of 25 entering his seventh NBA season, many consider Devin Booker to be entering the prime of his career. But knowing his work ethic and commitment to self-improvement, Booker seems to feel he has only scratched the surface of his vast potential. He will undoubtedly study the league's best players to steal moves and tendencies from them. Combined with his natural talents and gifted scoring repertoire, the ceiling appears extremely high for Booker. If he keeps expanding his game, a perennial All-NBA selection and even an MVP award may not be out of the question down the road. Booker is eager to prove he has much more to contribute.

### The Sun Continues to Rise in Phoenix
Led by the ascension of their young superstar Devin Booker, the Phoenix Suns have transformed from a perennial lottery team to a fixture in the Western Conference playoff picture. Powered by an experienced core of players still nearing their prime, success for this group may have only just begun. Under Booker's leadership, the Suns look poised to cement themselves among the elite sooner rather than later. Both player and franchise still feel they have more history left to make together. Exciting times are ahead in the Valley of the Sun as their brightest star shines ever more luminously.

### Conclusion
Over seven seasons, Devin Booker's evolution from prolific scorer to complete all-around offensive weapon and unquestioned team leader has been tremendous to witness. He is still developing other aspects of his game on both ends while cementing a place among the NBA's elite talents. With continued growth and a championship still ahead, Booker's best basketball clearly remains ahead of him. Just as he has pushed himself every step of the way, the Phoenix Suns also seem to be riding his coattails to greater heights. Their partnership is sure to bring many more thrills for years to come.
