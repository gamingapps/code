### The Original Mario Bros. vs Super Mario Bros. 

The original Mario Bros. was a single screen arcade game released in 1983 where players jumped under enemies to knock them over. In contrast, Super Mario Bros. was released on the NES in 1985 as a platforming game where players progressed through levels and worlds to defeat Bowser and save the princess. Game developer Shigeru Miyamoto envisioned SMB as a much grander game that could be replayed over and over on the NES home console rather than the arcade format. SMB departed significantly from the original's restrictive single screen format into a new expansive side-scrolling adventure.
